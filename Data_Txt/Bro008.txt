__s^tc__okay .__c4
__fh__okay .__c3
__s^co__we can start ?__c3
__fh__okay .__c4
__s^rt^tc__okay .__c3
__s^t__so welcome to our next meeting .__c3
__s.x__uh | today we will have a talk from miguel sanchez concerning his uh work related to ad hoc networks .__c3
__fh|s__we have here a guest a former icsi member of the n. s. a group jordi domingo pasqual .__c3
__fh__he is uh assistant professor at u. p. c .__c3
__qy^br^d^rt__and maybe jordi you have a few words concerning your work .__c3
__s.%--__one or two sentence .__c3
__fh|s.x__and because we will have tomorrow a talk from him in more detail concerning what's going on .__c3
__s^bk^rt__uh you - you want me to say ?==__cb
__s__yeah | only a short introduction .__c3
__s^e__oh .__cb
__b__ve- - very short introduction please .__c3
__s^bk__of course .__cb
__fh|s.x__uh | well i'm working in the them broadband commu- ==__cb
__fh|s.x__uh sorry | one interruption .__c3
__fh|s.%--__this is not related to hearing .__c3
__b^rt__it's only for fixing it .__c3
__s__it's not a earphone .__c3
__s.%--__uh it's not a hear ==__cb
__s__no .__c3
__fh|s__so ==__c3
__fg__it works like - like this .__cb
__fh|s^co^rt__yeah yeah .__c3
__s^rt__like this one .__c3
__s^df__yeah .__c3
__s^e__uh .__cb
__s.%-__it's only a microphone .__c3
__s^m.%-__that's ==__cb
__s^2__uh .__cb
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__fh|s^df^rt__that's uh much more comfortable .__cb
__fh|s__okay .__c3
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__s.%--__okay .__c3
__fh__thank- - thank you .__cb
__qy^br^d^rt__i'm uh working in the broadband communications group .__cb
__s^r__and uh ==__cb
__s^aa__uh ==__cb
__s^e__well | the research topics at this moment is uh i. p. eighty traffic monitoring and characterization and them uh tool - developing tools uh for quality of service uh performance analysis .__cb
__fh__that's uh - and we have several projects uh both spanish and european projects ongoing .__cb
__qw^rt__uh | in this area .__cb
__h|s__okay .__c3
__s^m^rt__thank you .__c3
__fh__and after the talk of uh miguel i will give you all a few slides concerning the project proposal .__c3
__fh__i will um say something about in which direction it will go .__c3
__fh__and ==__c3
__s.%--__uh ==__c3
__s__maybe it was my fault that i assumed that the pointer of miguel concerning u. m. t. s services was deployed to everybody .__c3
__fh__but it was only sent to me .__c3
__sj^ba__so in the meantime everybody got i believe this pointer from me .__c3
__sj^ba^r__and ==__c3
__b__maybe we - it's a homework in principle for the next meeting to get a little bit familiar with these things .__c3
__b__worse than no work .__c0
__fh|s__and um ==__c3
__s^df__so i believe we will not have today a very hard technical discussion .__c3
__s^df__maybe more a few topic and items we will focus in the next days until the next meeting .__c3
__b__and when we are ready with our meeting .__c3
__fh__everything is done .__c3
__b__then uh we have to read these number .__c3
__fh__and we go around here every member .__c3
__fh__okay .__c1
__s^cc__so ==__c3
__sj^ba__okay .__c4
__fh__miguel please .__c3
__s__thank you .__c4
__s__well uh i - i have prepared uh a really short talk about some of the topics .__c4
__fh|s__i - i have been doing some w- - some research work uh before coming here .__c4
__s__and uh | well mainly i will present .__c4
__fh__uh here you have more or less the sketch of the presentation .__c4
__sj^ba__i will present some ideas and some concepts about what ad hoc networks are .__c4
__s__about the issues in media access control in wireless networks .__c4
__fh__also about routing in such kind of networks .__c4
__s__and uh | i will make some comments also about uh the current standards of wireless local area networks .__c4
__fh__and finally i will present the blueprint of - of my research project or my research uh proposal here .__c4
__s__so | the first thing is uh what an ad hoc network is .__c4
__s__you know uh an ad hoc network is made of wireless nodes .__c4
__s.x__these nodes of course can be mobile nodes .__c4
__b__and uh in this network there is no network infrastructure .__c4
__b__so uh | the only active thing we have is the mobile nodes .__c4
__fh__and uh ==__c4
__fh__end to end communication is sometimes uh done by direct communication from one node to the other .__c4
__qw^rt__because they can talk to each other .__c4
__s^no__but sometimes it is not possible this direct communication because nodes end - uh source or - and destination nodes are um - are too far away .__c4
__s^bk__and in this case it can be done communication can be done by uh using multi hub routing .__c4
__fh|s__so ==__c4
__s__an intermediate or a set of intermediate nodes will route or will forward the packet from the sender to the destination .__c4
__s^bk__so ==__c4
__sj__uh | in a sense what we have in this kind of networks is that uh nodes are as both arced as both uh endpoints and also routers of other neighboring nodes .__c4
__s__and this makes a uh difference from other kind of network .__c4
__fh|s__and well regarding the purposes of what can this kind of network be used for uh we can say that well cellular networks are infrastructure based networks .__c4
__s__in this kind of ad hoc networks we don't have anything uh with the exception of the network nodes .__c4
__s^e__so this uh network can be useful for uh uh occasions where no available infrastructure is present .__c4
__s^bk__like for example in - in - uh after some kind of - of - uh um catastrophe- - catastrophic event .__c4
__s^bk__or also when - even when there is a network available we don't want for different reasons to use the available network .__c4
__fh|s__this latt- - later case can be for example the use in military systems .__c4
__s__where maybe we don't want to use the other - the enemy network infrastructure for evident reasons .__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__huh ?__c3
__s__but you can also i believe uh to have an ad hoc network where one node is then connecting to the outer world .__c3
__sj^fe__for instance what i have in mind you have a car where you plug in different devices and they talk to each other for instance .__c3
__fh|s.x__but one device decided to go to the g. s. m network or g. p. s network or whatever kind of things .__c3
__b__that's okay .__c4
__s.%--__so there's a certain kind of task uh for one node within the ad hoc network to provide connectivity to the outer world .__c3
__fh|s__right ?__c3
__s__that's okay .__c4
__s__okay .__c3
__qy.%--__that's perfect you know .__c4
__qw^rt__yeah .__c3
__h|s__this - in this case we will say that this node is acting as a - as a gat- - external gateway from this network to connect to other networks .__c4
__fh|s__right .__c3
__s.x__and of course the underlying uh protocols can can be of course uh i. p. based .__c4
__s__uh okay .__c4
__fh|s__here you have several - several uh proposed uh scenarios for - for used this networks .__c4
__s^bk__when no network is available .__c4
__fh__okay .__c4
__fh|s__and another - another application for example nasa is - is uh studying is uh the use of these networks these ad hoc networks for sending multiple probes uh um uh missions .__c4
__fh|s.%--__so for example all of you are aware of this uh - the last atlas the last successful uh mars mission .__c4
__s__the cellular vehicle was only one and was uh walking around - uh roaming around the base station which in this case was the gateway uh node of this network .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__but it was only one mobile node of course .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__nothing prevents .__c4
__qrr.%--__except well maybe the cost to send not only one mobile rover but ten tons of them or - or at least uh several of them .__c4
__s.x__so uh ==__c4
__s^e__higher area could be covered - could be explored .__c4
__s^e.%-__and uh of course all the different nodes could also use some kind of ad hoc networking ad hoc routing to extend the distance the maximum distance than uh a single radio transmission will - would allow .__c4
__fg__okay ?__c4
__s^bc__@@ ==__c3
__fh|s^df__and in the other case or the other area uh of - of - of application is the so-called network of sensors .__c4
__%--__where we can deploy a set of sensors in a maybe uninhabited area .__c4
__s^df__let's say for example the forest .__c4
__s^aa__and we can uh take some information .__c4
__s__uh | for example for - for fire fighting we can just launch from a plane several small sensors .__c4
__s__and uh ==__c4
__s__these sensors can be for example uh checking that there is no fire .__c4
__b__they can have some kind of uh let's say infrared technology sensor .__c4
__b__so we can cover a huge area with only a small set of - of sensors and without any other infrastructure .__c4
__s__yeah ?__c4
__s__um | is that really an ad hoc network ?__c1
__fh|s__because the sensors are not moving .__c1
__s__and i think it's - makes no sense with moving sensors because then you don't know where the sensors are .__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__so ==__c1
__fh__well ==__c4
__fh|s^cs__you know it's an interesting question .__c4
__s__uh the - the main thing about an ad hoc network is not that nodes move .__c4
__s__it is the way of topology changes can happen .__c4
__b__the idea that huh any change is possible at any given moment .__c4
__qy^rt__but you can of course ask but if the nodes are not moving what kind of topology changes can we expect .__c4
__qrr.%--__yeah .__c1
__h|s^nd__that's it .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__well uh | the thing is that usually in - in a n- - in a network of sensors what we have or the idea is to have um an important number of sensors and maybe with a high filer rate .__c4
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s^df__maybe the batteries are uh exhausted in some nodes because maybe uh they are not being able to take uh let's say any sun to recharge its cells .__c4
__fh|s__okay .__c1
__fh|s__uhhuh .__c1
__b__uh maybe some of them can be uh just uh out of order for other uh environmenta- - environmental conditions .__c4
__s__so uh | the idea is that even when these nodes are not moving they can start and stop working at uh let's say higher pace .__c4
__s__then uh what will happen in a - in a regular network uh in a network where you don't have or - either mobility or uh this uh on off uh rate high rate .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk__let me go back to your uh uh example .__c3
__b^rt__huh .__c1
__fg__yeah .__c4
__fh|s.%-__have in mind some routers are burnt here at icsi or whatever kind of thing .__c3
__s^bu__what will happen then even in a fixed network ?__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s^bk__so | if some sensors are getting out of uh service and whatever kind of thing so the topology has changed even if no node is moving .__c3
__fh__okay .__c1
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__fh__okay .__c1
__fh|s__and how to provide the connectivity and the intercommunication things wi- - within this network .__c3
__fh__thank you joe .__c4
__fh|s__yeah .__c1
__b__i see .__c1
__fh|s__uhhuh .__c1
__qw__well ==__c4
__qr^d^rt__uh you know | and finally uh another nonmilitary applications where uh maybe a network is available like for example a room like this .__c4
__s__where we have in fa- - in fact a wired infrastructure .__c4
__s__but this uh possible application of ad hoc networks could be uh any place any meeting room where we arrive with our computers .__c4
__s^aa__and uh we just can communicate seamlessly to each other without any kind of access point any kind of uh huh external network .__c4
__b__because the kind of work we want to do is just only local based .__c4
__s^bk__it's only to chat to each other or to exchange files with the person which is in front of us .__c4
__s^am^rt__okay .__c4
__s^aa__but we n- - don't want to product - pro- - provide uh access to the internet or something .__c4
__s__okay ?__c4
__b.x__and of course the same uh - the same scenario could also happen in a place where there is no uh infrastructure available .__c4
__fh__let's say a meeting room uh in - in the middle of the desert .__c4
__s.%--__okay ?__c4
__fh__without any other network .__c4
__fh|s__so ==__c4
__fh__the point - or - or the question could be for some of us the idea of saying okay .__c4
__s^aa__that sounds okay .__c4
__s^am__but why not to use a longer transmission range so we can reach any destination in just one hop ?__c4
__s.%-__this seems to make sense because well uh we are this way avoiding all the routing problem .__c4
__s__that well we will talk a little bit uh about routing later .__c4
__s.%-__but uh ==__c4
__fg__it - it seems that i- - probably that the problem is - is not an easy one .__c4
__fh|s^co.x__because uh a node's moving the route is changing .__c4
__fh|s__so w- - one can think that routing in this uh scenario is - is a complex thing .__c4
__s__but the problem is if w- - we just uh try to put more power in each tr- - transmitter .__c4
__b__so this uh transmitter can reach any destination in only one hop .__c4
__b__what we are doing is uh to rising the power needs of each node .__c4
__sj^j__and also we are reducing the network uh throughput .__c4
__fh|s^j.x__because we are only allowing one transmissio- - one transmission at a time .__c4
__%--__because uh well we cannot allow several transmissions - several high-powered transmissions at the same time .__c4
__fh__because one is interfering with the other .__c4
__fh|s.%--__okay ?__c4
__s__we are ==__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__uh i think i'm not telling it yet .__c4
__fh__but we are assuming that we are using a single common channel for all the nodes .__c4
__s^aa__okay ?__c4
__s__so that's why we cannot allow several transmitters in the same channel at the same time .__c4
__s^bk__okay ?__c4
__s__so the idea of hav- - having a longer transmission range is not a good one .__c4
__fh__or at least it has the drawbacks um um i was telling you .__c4
__fh__uh | let's speak a little bit about the media access issues in - in wireless networks .__c4
__fh|qy^bu.%--__uh | you know the easiest uh way to - to show how this works is - or at least one of - i think one of the easiest - is that this drawing or this picture .__c4
__fg|s__what - what we have is a set of nodes each one at a different location .__c4
__s^bu__at - at - at a - at an - at a given moment this uh node this dash node is - is transmitting .__c4
__s^bk__and uh the arrows are representing this transmission .__c4
__s^aa__and the receiving nodes these three nodes are receiving the transmission .__c4
__s^aa^m__and i'm trying to uh show the area the covered area for - of this transmission by means of this uh dashed uh line circle .__c4
__s^bk^r__okay ?__c4
__s__so uh | any transmission has a maximum transmission range .__c4
__s^aa.x__and uh | in the simpler way we can see this like a circle with the center in the transmitter and a certain radius .__c4
__s^aa^r.x__okay ?__c4
__fh__the value of this radius is uh in principle is a fixed value .__c4
__sj^ba__and it depends on the uh power of the transmitter .__c4
__s^cc__of course uh this is only our uh simplife- - simplified model .__c4
__sj^ba__and of course this can be uh improved uh a lot .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__okay ?__c4
__qrr.%--__and in fact the real behavior is not exactly this one .__c4
__h|s.%--__but uh for - for what i want to say it's - it's - okay .__c4
__b.x__it's enough .__c4
__h__okay ?__c4
__s^cs:qy__so ==__c4
__s^cs__what are the differences uh in this - in this uh wireless transmission regarding uh to the wireless - to the wired ones ?__c4
__s__what - what are the d- - the main differences ?__c4
__sj^cs__well the main differences come from the fact that uh in uh - in uh wireless transmission we have a special domain we don't have when we are using a wire for transmitting a signal .__c4
__fh|sj__and the point i'm trying to show in this picture is that if for example this other node wants also to transmit while this one was transmitting if we are using some kind of carry detect scheme like for example c. s. m. a or something uh uh derivated from it the problem is that this node will hear the g- - the m- - the transmission media .__c4
__sj__it won't be able to hear anything .__c4
__fh__so he will conclude that no other transmission is going on .__c4
__fh|s^rt__and he will start transmitting .__c4
__s.%--__and if he does what will happen is that this node and this other node will also receive this transmission .__c4
__s__and this will produce at least at these two nodes a collision or a m- - a m- - a - a re- - a bad reception .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__okay ?__c4
__fh|s__so none of these two simultaneous transmissions will be properly received at this node nor at this other node .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__okay .__c4
__h|s^aa__uh | this problem is what is called ==__c4
__s^e__oh sorry .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__uh | the ==__c4
__fh__i think this is the previous one .__c4
__s__this is the german ==__c4
__s.%--__uh ==__c3
__s__no .__c0
__s__one ==__c0
__b__yes .__c3
__s__okay .__c4
__fh|s__@@ ==__c0
__s__this one .__c3
__fh__thank you .__c4
__qy^bu^rt__uh ==__c4
__s^df__this is what is called a hidden terminal problem .__c4
__s^aa|s.%-__okay ?__c4
__s__because well uh this node is not able to hear this other node because of the distance uh between them .__c4
__fh|s__but uh this problem as you can see in the - in the picture is uh really producing at least some reception problem at these two nodes .__c4
__fh|s__okay .__c4
__fh|s__so it is - it is a problem that we have to address .__c4
__s__and it is a new problem compared to wired uh media access control .__c4
__s__and uh ==__c4
__s__well some devel- - some protocols have been developed to avoid this problem and to try to address this particular behavior of wireless transmissions .__c4
__s__and the main idea is to use some kind of a reservation mechanism .__c4
__fh|s__so ==__c4
__s__we are um reserving a certain and a specific uh area of space so we can guarantee that nobody is trying to use the same space at the same time .__c4
__fh__okay .__c4
__s__this is the basic idea .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__um ==__c3
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s__miguel can you give some examples for such kind of protocols ?__c3
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s__yeah | in fact ==__c4
__fh|s^r^tc__one is really - really ==__c3
__s^df__this one .__c4
__s__this one n- - next slide is ==__c4
__fh|s__okay .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__yeah yeah .__c3
__fh|s^t__okay .__c3
__b__okay .__c4
__s__in uh the - the - the main idea and - and the base of most of this protocols is what this - the so-called r. t. s c. t. s uh dialogue .__c4
__fh|s__the idea is that ==__c4
__fg__uh ==__c4
__h__of course this is only intended for unicast transmissions .__c4
__s__i mean only for when a node wants to transmit something to a neighbor node .__c4
__s^df__okay ?__c4
__s.%--__but not to broadcast uh to all the nodes .__c4
__s^bk^rt__okay .__c4
__fh__for this - for this uh work the transmitter has to send a - a - a reservation packet called r. t. s request to send before uh being able to send data .__c4
__s__and the receiver is expected to return back another packet called c. t. s clear to send to allow the transmitter to send the data .__c4
__s__if the transmitter receives successfully the c. t. s packet from the destination then it will be able to send uh the packet - the data packet .__c4
__s^bk__if not it will h- - uh back off and it will retry uh sometime later .__c4
__b__okay .__c4
__s^e__so the main idea ==__c4
__s^aa__and the media is - is - is still occupied during that period ?__c3
__s^aa^r__or ?==__c3
__s__uh ==__c4
__%--__yes .__c4
__sj^cs__yes .__c4
__fh|s__okay .__c3
__sj^cs__the idea is uh if i want to send you something i - first of all i need you to answer me to be sure that you are my neighbor now .__c4
__b.%__because maybe you are off or maybe you are uh too far away .__c4
__fh__and also because that way miguel for example it may be is not being able to hearing me will hear your c. t. s and will know that you are about to receive uh data from me .__c4
__fg|sj^cs__okay ?__c4
__b.%__so ==__c4
__fh|s__in fact forcing the receiver to transmit for a short period of time is also uh used to signal all the uh receiver neighbors that a recept- - a reception is taking place .__c4
__s__okay .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__s.%--__i didn't get it .__c3
__b^rt__um | what happened when i sent an r. t. s packet ?__c3
__s__is then the media still occupied for me ?__c3
__b^rt__or is anybody allowed also to send r. t. s packets ?__c3
__s^aa__or everybody ==__c4
__s__because if i go to an intermediate node maybe you are communicating to me .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__and i am the intermediate node to the final destination michael .__c3
__s^aa__and michael send also some r. t. s packet in the time and - and - uh uh uh jordi too and whatever .__c3
__s.x__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__then you will never come to a really ==__c3
__s.%--__then you're always exchanging r. t. s and non acknowledgement packets for the r. t. s .__c3
__fh|s.%--__okay .__c4
__s__two - two things .__c4
__s__so that's uh - that's uh my - my problem .__c3
__s__first of all uh this - this mechanism is only a media access controlled mechanism .__c4
__b__so it is not connected with routing uh anyhow .__c4
__s__then fine .__c3
__fh|qy^bu^d^rt__and second point .__c4
__s^ar__okay .__c3
__s__uh ==__c4
__qy^d^m__so it's only related to the direct neighbor within the scope of the transmissions .__c3
__s^rt__r. t. s ==__c4
__b^rt__yeah .__c4
__s__r. t. s packets can collide to other r. t. s packets .__c4
__s__okay .__c3
__b^rt__so this mechanism is not uh preventing collisions .__c4
__fh|s^rt__it is preventing only data collisions .__c4
__s__okay ?__c4
__fh|sj__okay .__c3
__s^bk__so the ==__c4
__b.x__and - and - you can say okay .__c4
__s^bk__but what is the - what the benefit is .__c4
__s__the benefit is that uh r. t. s packets and c. t. s packets are short packets .__c4
__fg__really short packets .__c4
__qw.%--__let's say uh uh 30 bytes or less .__c4
__%-__i assume so .__c3
__fg__yeah .__c3
__fg|s__while data packets can be much mor- - much bigger .__c4
__s^co__let's say uh one k. five k.s .__c4
__s^rt__okay ?__c4
__qy^bu^rt__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__so ==__c4
__s__fine .__c3
__fh__a collision in this short packet is only wasting a small amount of time .__c4
__h|s^bk__and uh ==__c4
__fh__if that way we can warranty that there is - there are - there is no collision uh uh between data packet well this - this is - this means a - a huge uh increase in network throughput .__c4
__fg__because we- - well we - we only waste really small time colliding .__c4
__s^bk__okay .__c3
__fh__okay ?__c4
__s.%--__but that means in principle that on the mac layer you have always a r. t. s c. t. s packet between neighboring nodes .__c3
__fh|s__yeah .__c4
__b__and you send afterwards the data .__c3
__s^e__but the data will be maybe delayed in the intermediate node because you have always be assured to be uh s- - uh uh r. t. s and c. t. s packets are changed before - before you can forewarning the data .__c3
__b__right ?__c3
__fh__yeah .__c4
__fg|s^aa__it is a reservation mechanism .__c4
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__b__okay .__c3
__b__so ==__c4
__b__if reservation doesn't work okay if uh one reservation don't succeed then uh this transmission should have to wait .__c4
__b__now the p- ==__c3
__s^cs__until the reservation ==__c4
__s__okay .__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__sj__let me ==__c4
__fh|sj__maybe it's better to - to uh draw it on the ==__c3
__fh__oops .__c3
__b__l- - let me ==__c4
__fh|%-__so | maybe my idea first .__c3
__fg|%-__so this is what node one ?__c3
__s.%-__this is node two .__c3
__s__and this is the source .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__and this is node three that is the final destination .__c3
__%-__yeah .__c4
__fg__fo- - fo- - for- - forget - forget about routing .__c4
__s^m__yeah ?__c3
__s__yeah yeah .__c3
__s__okay .__c3
__b__but- - but anyway i would like to do that in the ad hoc network .__c3
__b^rt__this is maybe the sco- - this is within the scope of this uh special network .__c3
__%--__that means here that is uh within the transmission power .__c3
__fh__okay .__c4
__fh|s^cc__so if i send an r. t. s and get back um a c. t. s then he is allowed to send data | right ?__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__fh__a c. t. s .__c4
__s^no__that's okay .__c4
__fh|s__so in the meantime when he gets this one he also had to send r. t. s and then c. t. s .__c3
__sj^ba__because this is the next- - next scope of the transmission area .__c3
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c4
__fh.%__and then he can send the data | right ?__c3
__s^na.x__okay .__c4
__s__that's the case ?__c3
__s__that's it .__c4
__s^cs__that's ==__c4
__s^am__yeah .__c3
__s__and that's what i mean .__c3
__fh|s__in the meantime he c- - still can get some data here where he try to get certain connectivity on the mac layer .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s^cs^rt__yeah | but uh a node is only - is only involved in one transmission at a given time .__c4
__b__so ==__c4
__s^rt__if now two has uh huh answer with the - with the c. t. s it will be waiting until the data that has to come .__c4
__s^na__yeah ?__c3
__s^df__okay .__c3
__s__okay ?__c4
__fh__and then he try to forward this data .__c3
__fh|s.%-__yeah .__c4
__s^2__after that .__c3
__s^na__but n- - not before .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__so he is definitely first to stop .__c3
__fh|sj__he has to collect all the data .__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__yeah | you cannot ==__c4
__fh|s__could it not be a little bit strange ?__c3
__qy^d^g__because if that is starting a file transfer with millions of bytes he have to collect all the bytes before he forwarding to - to whatever .__c3
__s__no no no .__c4
__s^aa__but - we are - we are talking only about a data packet .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__huh ?__c3
__s__one data p- ==__c3
__b__at the mac layer .__c4
__fh__he have to do it for all data packets ?__c3
__fh|s^tc__yeah .__c4
__b__okay .__c3
__b__okay .__c3
__fh|s__so but in principle when he receives the data packet then he - the same applies for the next data packet .__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^e__all the packets .__c4
__b__all unicast packets .__c4
__fh__but anyway in the meantime he has to forward the packet to the final destination .__c3
__fh|s__yeah .__c4
__fh|s__that - that true .__c4
__fh|s__right ?__c3
__fh__that's true .__c4
__fh__so it's acting in - in prin- ==__c3
__s^j__but not in the meantime .__c4
__fh|s^df.x__after receiving you know in fact probably the routing protocol will need to check the address the - the let's say i. p address which is inside the data packet .__c4
__s__okay .__c3
__sj^ba__yeah .__c3
__s__so ==__c4
__fh__you cannot - u- - usually you cannot uh read the data packet until you - the reception is over .__c4
__sj^df.%--__okay ?__c4
__s__because usually your network hardware only provides you a copy of a packet after ou- - a - a successful reception .__c4
__s.%--__and usually you know that reception is successful if every bit has passed the c. r. c check .__c4
__fh|s__okay ?__c4
__s__you have checked that the - that this frame has received uh without errors .__c4
__s__naja to - to - @@ ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__fh__okay ?__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__yeah @@ .__c3
__fh__okay .__c3
__fh|s__so ==__c4
__fh__um | a further question .__c1
__fh|s__yeah .__c4
__fh__um ==__c1
__b__that's okay .__c4
__fg__am i right that this um dialogue does not prevent um any disturbance of other nodes in the um sending range of yeah n. one ?__c1
__%--__yeah | let me - let me put some special representation of what we are doing .__c4
__fg__s- ==__c1
__s^df.%--__okay .__c4
__s__this is the transmitting node .__c4
__s__this is the receiving node .__c4
__b__and these two areas of course there's something like this are the uh places of the total space where you can hear the here this one is the r. t. s and this one is the c. t. s .__c4
__s^df^rt__uhhuh .__c1
__b__so any node ==__c4
__fh__for example this node is a neighbor of the receiving node .__c4
__h__uhhuh .__c1
__s__but it is not a neighbor of the transmitting node .__c4
__s^e__yeah .__c1
__b__that's it .__c1
__b__so when this node hears the c. t. s transmission that is performed by the receiver this will be uh informed that a recev- - a reception is taking place in - in - in it's area .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__h__uhhuh .__c1
__b__okay ?__c4
__fg__so ==__c4
__sj__in fact this node will avoid any further transmission until uh this reception that will start in - in a moment is over .__c4
__fh__but then this node um this transmission is uh aborted .__c1
__fh__okay ?__c4
__s^co.%--__and delayed .__c3
__qy^d^rt__and so there's no advantage to uh - if it's aborted by - by any data packets .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__qw__so this um node has to stop each transmission .__c1
__qo.%--__yeah .__c4
__s^j__so | even the at the moment ongoing transmission .__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__uhhuh .__c4
__s__is that right ?__c1
__s^no__yeah .__c4
__fg|%--__so his transmission is aborted .__c1
__%__yeah but this is typical for mac layer protocols you know .__c3
__s__not ==__c4
__fh|s.x__no .__c4
__b__no .__c4
__s^bk__that's ==__c3
__b__let me - let me - let me show you one thing .__c4
__b__if this node was transmitting before it should uh it should ha- - uh transmit an r. t. s packet in advance | okay ?__c4
__fh|s^e.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__fh__uhhuh .__c1
__b__so this node should hear it before .__c4
__s^rt__yeah .__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__fh__that's right .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s^no^rt__uhhuh .__c1
__b__so this node is w- - won't be sending the uh uh c. t. s packet to the transmitter .__c4
__s^rt__okay .__c1
__b__yeah .__c1
__sj^ba__yeah .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__b__so this transmission won't take place .__c4
__b__okay .__c1
__fg|s__yeah .__c1
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__fh|s.%--__it's always true that only one node gets a media access for one frame .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__s:qw__uhhuh .__c1
__s__that's the point .__c3
__qw__m- - yeah .__c4
__fh__we always said from data .__c3
__s__but it's really one frame .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__yeah .__c4
__s.x__yeah .__c3
__fh|sj^no__okay .__c3
__fh__and in fact uh there is another detail .__c4
__fh__it is not uh uh uh uh in - on the - on the slide .__c4
__s^t__and it is that both the r. t. s and the c. t. s packet uh have a field a control field where the total length of the data packet is shown .__c4
__qw^rt__uhhuh .__c1
__h|%-__so ==__c4
__qr^d^rt__when you hear one uh c. t. s or one uh r. t. s packet you know that the frame that they are trying to transmit or that this one is trying to transmit this one is about to receive you know the length .__c4
__s^ng__you know the bit rate .__c4
__qr.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__s^df__so you know that the amount of time you have to wait until you can try to get the control or t- - try to send your own transmission .__c4
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c1
__s^aa__okay .__c1
__s^bk__but this scenario is also nov- - uh only working if um both or all nodes have the same range of transmission .__c1
__s^df__so the s- - same radius of the sending range .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__huh | yeah .__c4
__s__so otherwise um this one node maybe um would hear his neighbor but not vice versa .__c1
__s^bk^m__uh well | we are assuming that uh huh all the - all the transmissions are bidirectional .__c4
__qw^rt__i mean uh you know | it depends .__c4
__h|sj__it depends mainly on - on the antenna gain and the transmission power and the receiver uh threshold .__c4
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c1
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c1
__s^bk__okay ?__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__b__but i'm thinking about this example you gave before .__c1
__b__maybe - maybe you are right .__c3
__fh|s^co^t__s- ==__c4
__fh|s^t__so what - what we are assuming is that all the nodes behave exactly the same regarding to uh transmission and receiving signals .__c4
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__but miguel this is a good point from - from dietmar .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c1
__fh__but maybe here is a wall .__c3
__fh|s^t__and this guy is behind the wall so his transmission rate is something like that .__c3
__qy^rt^t__yeah but - but ==__c4
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__but the - but in this case you know this - this idea this uh geometric idea can be - can be if you want uh deformed because of some obstacles .__c4
__s^aa__okay ?__c4
__s^aa__but this wall is working both ways .__c4
__sj^ba__it is not only making this node not to hear this one it's also making this one not to hear this node .__c4
__s^aa__but one of the ==__c1
__sj^ba__so ==__c4
__qh^co__if they ==__c4
__s__because of this wall if they are not neighbors well we can represent this putting this node like here .__c4
____but one of the um senders could be much stronger than the other one .__c1
____okay ?__c4
____no | but this is not the scenario we are assuming .__c4
____so ==__c1
____okay .__c1
__z__so that was my question .__c1
