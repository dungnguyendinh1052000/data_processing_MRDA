__z__so ==__c4
__z__okay | doesn't look like it crashed .__c4
__z__that's great .__c4
__z__so i think maybe what's causing it to crash is i keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it's working .__c8
__z__and so i think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash .__c8
__z__so i won't do that anymore .__c8
__z__and it looks like you've found a way of uh - mapping the location to the without having people have to give their names each time ?__c1
__z__sounds like an initialization thing .__c0
__z__i mean it's like you have the ==__c1
__z__no .__c8
__z__so you know that ==__c1
__z__i mean are you going to write down that i sat here ?__c1
__z__i'm going to collect the digit forms and write it down .__c8
__z__okay .__c1
__z__oh okay .__c2
__z__so ==__c8
__z__so they should be right .__c8
__z__with what's on the digit forms .__c8
__z__okay so i'll go ahead and start with digits .__c8
__z__DIGIT_TASK__c8
__z__u- ==__c8
__z__DIGIT_TASK__c8
__z__and i should say that uh you just pau- - you just read each line an- - and then pause briefly .__c8
__z__and start by giving the transcript number .__c4
__z__DIGIT_TASK__cb
__z__DIGIT_TASK__c4
__z__DIGIT_TASK__c5
__fg__transcript - uh okay - okay .__c3
__s^t__tran- ==__c0
__s^bk__oh sorry go ahead .__c0
__s^fa__DIGIT_TASK__c0
__fg__DIGIT_TASK__c1
__s^df__DIGIT_TASK__c2
__fg__DIGIT_TASK__c3
__fh|s.%--__so uh - you see don the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project .__c4
__s__okay .__cb
__s^ba__it's just uh ==__c4
__s^ba^fe__um ==__cb
__fg|s^rt__uh - | you know - it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have that information .__c4
__s__and i'm surprised i sort of - i'm surprised i forgot that .__c8
__fh|s__but uh - | i think that would be a good thing to add .__c8
__s^rt__yeah | i - i'd - i think it's some- ==__c4
__s^rt__after i just printed out a zillion of them .__c8
__s^ba__yeah well that's ==__c4
__%-__um - so i - i do have a - a- - an agenda suggestion .__c4
__s__uh - | we - i think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh - tend to be a mixture of uh - procedural uh - mundane things and uh - research points .__c4
__qy^rt__and um - | i was thinking - i think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we - we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff because that's easier to get out of the way .__c4
__s^na__and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that andreas had to leave .__c4
__s^no__so | uh - i'm suggesting we turn it around .__c4
__s^aa__and - and uh - sort of - we have - anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later uh - hold them for a bit and let's talk about the - the research y kind of things .__c4
__s^ft__um - so um | the one th- - one thing i know that we have on that is uh - we had talked a - a couple weeks before um - uh about the uh - the stuff you were doing with - with uh - um - uh - l- - l- - attempting to locate events .__c4
__s^bk__we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by events .__c4
__s__but i think - you know what we had meant by events i guess was uh points of overlap between speakers .__c4
__s^bk^m^rt__but i th- - i gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh - interruptions with something else .__c4
__s__like some other noise .__c4
__s^j^m__yeah .__c3
__fh|s__yes ?__c4
__s^bk__uhhuh yeah .__c3
__fh__you mean that as an event also ?__c4
__s__so at any rate you were - you've - you've done some work on that .__c4
__fh__to- ==__c3
__s^bu^rt__right .__c3
__s^aa__and um - | then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh - research uh - areas that uh - we're thinking about doing .__c4
__fh|s__um - | i think - especially since you - you haven't been in - in these meetings for a little bit .__c4
__s^rt__maybe you have some discussion of some of the p- - the plausible things to look at now that we're starting to get data .__c4
__s__uh - | and one of the things i know that also came up uh - is some discussions that - that uh - that uh jane had with lokendra .__c4
__s__uh - about some - some - some um - uh - work about ==__c4
__s__i - i - i d- - i - i don't want to try to say because i - i'll say it wrong .__c4
__fh|qy^rt__but anyway some - some potential collaboration there about - about the - about the - working with these data .__c4
__qy^rt__oh .__c2
__qy^d^j^rt__so ==__c4
__b__sure .__c2
__s^na__so uh ==__c4
__s^bk__you want to just go around ?__c8
__s__uh - | well i don't know if we - if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing .__c4
__qw__i think there's just - just a couple - a couple people primarily .__c4
__s^rt:s__um but um ==__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__uh - | wh- - why don't ?==__c4
__qw^rt__actually i think that - that last one i just said we could do fairly quickly .__c4
__s__so why don't you - you start with that ?__c4
__s^bk__okay .__c1
__qr__shall i - shall i just start ?__c1
__s^ba^fe__yeah | just explain what it was .__c4
__s^rt__okay .__c1
__s^bk__um - so | uh - he was interested in the question of you know - relating to his - to the research he presented recently - um - of inference structures .__c1
__s^cs__and uh - |  the need to build in um - this - this sort of uh - mechanism for understanding of language .__c1
__s^no__and he gave the example in his talk about how um ==__c1
__b__e- - a- - i'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now .__c1
__s^bd__but it's something about how um i- - joe slipped you know john had washed the floor or something like that .__c1
__s^bk__and i don't have it quite right .__c1
__s^fa__but that kind of thing .__c1
__s__where you have to draw the inference that okay there's this time sequence .__c1
__s^bd__but also the - the - the causal aspects of the uh - floor and - and how it might have been the cause of the fall .__c1
__%-__and that um - it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it .__c1
__s^bk__and it - these sorts of things .__c1
__s^bu^rt__so | i looked through the transcript that we have so far and um - fou- - identified a couple different types of things of that type .__c1
__s^m^na__and um - | one of them was something like uh - during the course of the transcript um - um - w- - we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on .__c1
__s^aa__and um - | the question was raised well should we restart the recording at this point .__c1
__s^bk^m__and - and | dan ellis said well we're just so far ahead of the game right now we really don't need to .__c1
__s__now how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ?__c1
__s__so | the inferences that are involved are things like - okay - so how do you interpret ahead of the game .__c1
__s^2^j__you know - | so it's the - it's - i- - what you - what you int- - what you draw - you know - the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording .__c1
__fh__huh | metaphorically .__c8
__s^ba__that - um i- - that i- - we have enough space .__c1
__s__and he continues like we're so ahead of the game because now we have built in down sampling .__c1
__s^bk__so you have to sort of get the idea that um - ahead of the game is sp- - speaking with respect to space limitations .__c1
__b.%__that um - that in fact down sampling is gaining us enough space .__c1
__b__and that therefore we can keep the recording we've done so far .__c1
__fh__but there are a lot of different things like that .__c1
__s__so do you think his interest is in using this as a data source ?__c8
__s^cs__or training material ?__c8
__s^bc__or what ?__c8
__s^cs__well | i - i should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that i had with him .__c4
__s^cs^rt__so um - | we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours .__c4
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c8
__s^bk^m__and um - uh - | i thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data uh - and um - such things might be useful for that in or- - before we invested too much uh - effort into that he should uh - with jane's help look into some of the data that we're already have .__c4
__s^bk^m__uhhuh .__c8
__s^bk__and see is there anything to this at all .__c4
__s__is there any point which you think that you know you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it .__c4
__fh__because it could be that you'd look through it and you say well this is just the wrong task for - for him to pursue his ==__c4
__s^nd^rt__wrong .__c8
__s^bd^fa__yeah .__c8
__fg|qo^cs^t^tc__and - and uh - | i got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that - that you looked at that - that it's plausible at least .__c4
__fh|s__it's possible .__c1
__s__uh - he was - he - he you know - we met and he was going to go and uh - you know y- - look through them more systematically .__c1
__qw^rt__yeah .__c4
__fh__and then uh - meet again .__c1
__s^bc__yeah .__c4
__s^rt__so it's - you know - not a matter of a ==__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__but - | yeah i think - i think it was optimistic .__c1
__s__so anyway | that's - that's e- - a quite different thing from anything we've talked about that you know - might - might - might come out from some of this .__c4
__s__but he can use text basically .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__i mean - he's talking about just using text .__c2
__%-__that's his major ==__c1
__qy^bc^d^rt__i mentioned several that w- - had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours .__c1
__s^aa^m__pretty much ?__c2
__qy^d^r^rt__or ?==__c2
__s__and that wasn't as directly relevant to what he's doing .__c1
__s^bk^m__okay .__c2
__s__he's interested in these - these knowledge structures .__c1
__s^bsc__yeah interesting .__c3
__s^j__inferences that you draw i- - from .__c1
__s__i mean - | he certainly could use text .__c4
__s^bk__but we were in fact looking to see if there - is there - is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in - in - in this stuff .__c4
__s__so ==__c4
__s^bk__and i imagine that transcripts of speech i mean text that is speech probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing .__c8
__s^bk__i - i don't know whether it would or not but it seems like it would .__c8
__%-__i don't know .__c4
__s^bk__probably de- - probably depends on what the prepared writing was .__c4
__fh__but ==__c4
__s__yeah | i don't think i would make that leap .__c1
__s^aa__because i- - in narratives you know i mean - if you spell out everything in a narrative it can be really tedious .__c1
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c8
__fh__so ==__c1
__s^ba__yeah i'm just thinking you know when you're - when you're face to face you have a lot of backchannel .__c8
__s.%-__and - and ==__c8
__qy^bu^d^rt__oh !__c1
__s^aa__that aspect .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c8
__s^bu__and so i think it's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it's face to face .__c8
__%-__i mean - so if i just read that dan was saying we're ahead of the game in that - in that context .__c8
__s^aa__well ==__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__s^ba__i might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else .__c8
__s__i - you know - i - i had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them .__c1
__fh|s__uhhuh .__c8
__b__this - this one really does um - m- - make you leap from ==__c1
__s.%-__so he said you know - we're ahead of the game w- - we have built in down sampling .__c1
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c8
__qy__and the inference - i- - if you had it written down would be ==__c1
__fh|s^rt__i guess it would be the same .__c8
__%-__uhhuh .__c1
__s__but there are others that have backchanneling .__c1
__b__it's just he was less interested in those .__c1
__s__can i ?==__c5
__s^bk|s__sorry to interrupt .__c5
__fh__um - | i - f- - f- - f- - i've d- - a minute uh - several minutes ago i like - briefly was - was not listening .__c5
__s.%--__and so who is he in this context ?__c5
__qy^rt__yeah | there's a lot of pronoun ==__c2
__s^am__okay .__c5
__s^e^rt__so i was just realizing we've - you guys have been talking about he um - for at least uh - i don't know three - three four minutes without ever mentioning the person's name again .__c5
__%-__i believe it .__c2
__s^df__yeah | actually to make it worse uh morgan uses you and you .__c2
__s.%-__so this is - this is - this is - going to be a big big problem if you want to later do uh - you know - indexing or speech understanding of any sort .__c5
__b__it's in my notes .__c8
__s^2__with gaze and no identification .__c2
__s^aa__or ==__c2
__s^cs.%-__i just wrote this down .__c2
__s__you just wrote this ?__c5
__b__yeah | actually because morgan will say well you had some ideas .__c2
__s^df^rt__yeah .__c3
__s__and he never said li- - he looked ==__c2
__b__well i think he's doing that intentionally .__c8
__s^cs.%--__right .__c2
__fh__aren't you ?__c8
__%-__so it's great .__c2
__s__right .__c5
__s^2__so this is really great .__c2
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__because the thing is because he's looking at the per- - even for addressees in the conversation .__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__fh__i bet you could pick that up in the acoustics .__c2
__s^co__just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice .__c2
__%-__uhhuh .__c4
__b__could be .__c4
__s^bk__yeah that would be tou- ==__c4
__qy^rt__oh that would be interesting .__c8
__qr^bu^rt__can we- ?==__c1
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s.%-__yeah | so that - i mean - to even know um when ==__c2
__s^cc__yeah if you have the p z m's you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice .__c2
__s^cc^r__well especially with morgan - with the way we have the microphones arranged i'm sort of right on axis .__c8
__s__and it would be very hard to tell .__c8
__%-__right .__c2
__s^bk__uh ==__c8
__b__oh but you'd have the ==__c1
__s.%-__put morgan always like this .__c2
__s^co__and ==__c2
__s^df__you'd have fainter ==__c1
__s^ba__well these ==__c4
__s^cs__wouldn't you get fainter reception out here ?__c1
__s^fe__sure but i think if i'm talking like this ==__c8
__qy^br^d^m^rt__right now i'm looking at jane and talking .__c8
__qh__now i'm looking at chuck and talking .__c8
__s^fe__i don't think the microphones would pick up that difference .__c8
__s.%-__but you don't have this - this problem .__c2
__s^am__i see .__c1
__s^bk__morgan is the one who does this most .__c2
__s^no^rt__so if i'm talking at you or i'm talking at you .__c8
__s^cc__i probably been affect- - no i th- - i think i've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about - and concerns about oh gee is somebody going to say something bad and so on .__c4
__s^t^tc__lawyers .__c8
__fh__and so i - | so i'm - i'm tending to stay away from people's names even though uh ==__c4
__fg|s__i am too .__c1
__s__even though you could pick up later on just from the acoustics who you were t- - who you were looking at .__c2
__s^bk__i am too .__c1
__fg|s__and we did mention who he was .__c8
__s^rt__yeah .__c2
__b__early in the conversation .__c8
__s^rt__yeah .__c4
__s__right | but i missed it .__c5
__s^rt__but it was uh ==__c5
__fh__do -  sh- - can i say ?==__c8
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^df__yeah yeah .__c2
__s^co__or - or is that just too sensitive ?__c8
__s^e__yeah .__c5
__fh|s__yeah no no | there's ==__c4
__s:s__no no it isn't sensitive at all .__c4
__s:s__well ==__c1
__fh__i was just - i was just - i was overreacting just because we've been talking about it .__c4
__%--__and in fact it is - it is - it is sensitive .__c1
__s:s__it's okay to ==__c4
__s__no but that ==__c2
__s^rt__it's interesting .__c2
__s^rt__i - i came up with something from the human subjects people that i wanted to mention .__c1
__fh__i mean it fits into the m- - area of the mundane .__c1
__s^rt__but they did say ==__c1
__s__you know - i asked her very specifically about this clause of how um - you know - it says no individuals will be identified .__c1
__s__uh - | in any publication using the data .__c1
__s__okay well individuals being identified .__c1
__fh__let's say you have a - a snippet that says joe s- - uh - thinks such and such about - about this field but i think he's wrongheaded .__c1
__s__now i mean - we're - we're going to be careful not to have the wrongheaded part in there .__c1
__s^cs:s__but - but - you know let's say we say you know - joe used to think so-and-so about this area in his publication he says that but i think he's changed his mind or whatever .__c1
__s:s__but i ==__c4
__s:s__then the issue of - of being able to trace joe because we know he's well known in this field and all this and - and tie it to the speaker whose name was just mentioned a moment ago can be sensitive .__c1
__s__so i think it's really - really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to .__c1
__s__because if there's a slanderous aspect to it then how much to we want to be able to have to remove .__c1
__fh__yeah well there's that .__c4
__s__but i - i mean - i think also to some extent it's just educating the human subjects people in a way .__c4
__qy^rt__because there's if uh - you know - there's court transcripts there's - there's transcripts of radio shows .__c4
__fg|qy^bu^d__i mean - people say people's names all the time .__c4
__s^bu__so i think it - it can't be bad to say people's names .__c4
__s^aa__it's just that i- - i mean - you're right that there's more poten- - if we never say anybody's name then there's no chance of - of - of slandering anybody .__c4
__s.%--__but | then it won't - i mean if we - if we ==__c2
__s:s__but ==__c4
__s:s__it's not a meeting .__c8
__fh__yeah i mean - we should do whatever's natural in a meeting if - if we weren't being recorded .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^bu__right | so i - so my behavior is probably not natural .__c4
__s^bk__so ==__c4
__s^ba__if person x  ==__c2
__b__well | my feeling on it was that it wasn't really important who said it .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__you know ?__c1
__s^aa|s__yeah .__c4
__s__well | if you ha- - since you have to um - go over the transcripts later anyway you could make it one of the jobs of the people who do that to mark ==__c5
__%-__well | we t- - we t- - we talked about this during the anon- - anonymization .__c8
__qy^bu^d.%--__if we want to go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name .__c8
__s^nd__right .__c5
__s^bk__and i thought that our conclusion was that we didn't want to do that .__c8
__b__yeah we really can't .__c4
__qy^bu^d__but a- - actually i'm sorry i really would like to push - finish this off .__c4
__s^aa|%--__i understand .__c1
__fh__no i just - i just was suggesting that it's not a bad policy p- - potentially .__c1
__s^rt__so it's ==__c4
__s^rt__so | we need to talk about this later .__c1
__b__yeah i di- - i didn't intend it an a policy though .__c4
__s__it was - it was just - it was just unconscious - well semi conscious behavior .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s__i sort of knew i was doing it but it was ==__c4
__s:s__well i still don't know who he is .__c5
__s__i - i do- - i don't remember who he is .__c4
__s^df__no you have to say you still don't know who he is with that prosody .__c2
__s__uh .__c4
__s^rt__uh - | we were talking about dan at one point and we were talking about lokendra at another point .__c4
__s^rt__oh .__c5
__s__yeah depends on which one you mean .__c1
__s__and i don't - i don't remember which - which part .__c4
__s^no__it's ambiguous so it's okay .__c2
__%-__uh - i think ==__c4
__s^bk__well the inference structures was lokendra .__c8
__s__but no the inference stuff was - was - was lokendra .__c5
__s__okay .__c5
__s:s__yeah yeah yeah .__c4
__s:s^cs__that makes sense yeah .__c5
__s:s__um ==__c4
__s__and the down sampling must have been dan .__c2
__s^bu__yeah .__c8
__s__good .__c4
__s^2__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__it's an inference .__c2
__b__yeah | you could do all these inferences .__c4
__s.%--__yeah .__c8
__s__yeah .__c4
__qo__yeah .__c4
__qo__um - | i - i would like to move it into - into uh - what jose uh - has been doing .__c4
__s__because he's actually been doing something .__c4
__qy^d^rt__yeah .__c1
__qy^d^rt__uhhuh .__c3
__qw^t3__so right .__c4
__s__okay .__c3
__%--__as opposed to the rest of us .__c5
__qw^br__okay .__c3
__s__i - i remind that me - my first objective uh - in the project is to - to study difference parameters .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt^t3__to - to find a a good solution to detect uh the overlapping zone in uh - speech recorded .__c3
__s__but uh - tsk uh - | in that way i - i - i begin to - to study and to analyze the ehn - the recorded speech uh - the different session .__c3
__qy^rt__to - to find and to locate and to mark uh - the - the different overlapping zone .__c3
__s__and uh - | so uh - i was uh - i am transcribing the - the first session .__c3
__%-__and i - i have found uh - uh - one thousand acoustic events .__c3
__s^bk__uh - | besides the overlapping zones uh i - i - i mean - the uh - breaths uh - aspiration uh - uh - talk uh - uh - clap .__c3
__s__uh - i don't know what is the different names uh - you use to to name the - the n- - speech .__c3
__s.%--__non speech sounds .__c0
__s^e^rt__yeah .__c3
__b__oh i don't think we've been doing it at that level of detail .__c8
__h|s.%--__so ==__c8
__s^t3__yeah .__c3
__s^bk^t3__uh | i - i - i do- - i don't need to - to - to huh - to m- - to label the - the different acoustic .__c3
__fh__but i prefer because uh - i would like to to study if uh - i - i will find uh - uh - a good uh - parameters uh - to detect overlapping .__c3
__s^bk^t3__i would like to - to - to test these parameters uh - with the another uh - uh - acoustic events .__c3
__s^2__to - nnn - to - uh - to find what is the um - the false uh - the false uh - hypothesis uh - nnn - which uh - are produced when we use the - the um - this uh - parameter uh - i mean - pitch uh uh difference uh - feature .__c3
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c8
__b__you know - | i think some of these um - that are the non speech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there's two there .__c0
__s__so it was ==__c8
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__i mean - if it's a tapping sound you wouldn't necessarily - or - you know - something like that it'd be - it might be hard to know that it was two separate events .__c0
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__fg|qy.%--__well | you weren't talking about just overlaps .__c8
__b__ye- ==__c3
__fh__were you ?__c8
__s__you were just talking about acoustic events .__c8
__b__i - i - i - i t- - i t- - i talk uh - about uh - acoustic events in general .__c3
__s.%-__someone starts someone stops .__c8
__s^bk|s__yeah .__c8
__b__but uh - my - my objective uh - will be uh - to study uh - overlapping zone .__c3
__qy^d^f^g^rt__oh .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__b__uh n- - uh | in twelve minutes i found uh - uh - one thousand acoustic events .__c3
__b__how many overlaps were there uh - in it ?__c4
__%--__no no | how many of them were the overlaps of speech though ?__c4
__s:s__how many ?__c3
__qy__uh - | almost uh - three hundred uh - in one session .__c3
__b__oh god !__c8
__s.%--:s.%--__in five uh - in forty five minutes .__c3
__s:s__ugh .__c8
__s:s__three hundred overlapping speech .__c0
__qy^d^f^g^rt__alm- - three hundred overlapping zone .__c3
__b__overlapping speech .__c2
__s:s__with the overlapping zone - overlapping speech - speech what uh different duration .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__sure .__c4
__s^ar__does this ?==__c1
__s:qw__so if you had an overlap involving three people how many times was that counted ?__c1
__s__yeah | three people two people .__c3
__b__uh - um - | i would like to consider uh - one people with difference noise uh - in the background .__c3
__s:s__be- ==__c3
__b__no no | but i think what she's asking is if at some particular - for some particular stretch you had three people talking instead of two did you call that one event ?__c4
__s__oh .__c3
__b__oh .__c3
__qy^d^f^g^rt__yeah .__c3
__s__i consider one event uh - for th- - for that uh - for all the zone .__c3
__b__this - th- - i - i - i con- - i consider - i consider uh - an acoustic event the overlapping zone the period where three speaker or uh - are talking together .__c3
__s__well - | so let's ==__c8
__s^bk|s__for- ==__c1
__s^bu__so let's say me and jane are talking at the same time .__c8
__s^na__and then liz starts talking also over all of us .__c8
__s^bk__how many events would that be ?__c8
__fh__so- - i don't understand .__c3
__s^bu__so | two people are talking and then a third person starts talking .__c8
__s^na__yeah ?__c3
__qy^d^rt__is there an event right here ?__c8
__s^aa|s__uh - | no no no .__c3
__fh__for me is the overlapping zone .__c3
__s__because - because you - you have - s- - you have more one uh - more one voice uh uh produced in a - in - in a moment .__c3
__s^ng__so i- - if two or more people are talking ==__c8
__qy^d^f^g^rt__i see .__c4
__s^bk__okay .__c4
__b__yeah so i think - | yeah - we just wanted to understand how you're defining it .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__s.%-__so then | in the region between - since there- - there is some continuous region in between regions where there is only one person speaking .__c4
__b__if- ==__c3
__s^rt__uhhuh .__c3
__s__and one contiguous region like that you're calling an event .__c4
__s__is it - are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event ?__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__s.%--__or are you calling the entire length of it the event ?__c4
__s__i consider the - the nnn - the nnn - nnn uh - the entirety .__c3
__s__uh - uh - all - all the time there were the voice has overlapped .__c3
__b__okay .__c4
__s^rt__this is the idea .__c3
__s__but uh - i - i don't distinguish between the - the numbers of uh - speaker .__c3
__b__uh - i'm not considering uh - the - the um - uh - the fact of uh - uh - for example - what did you say .__c3
__s__uh - | at first uh - uh - two talkers are uh - uh - speaking .__c3
__s__and uh - uh - a third person uh - join to - to that .__c3
__b__for me it's uh - it's uh - all - overlap zone with uh - several numbers of speakers is uh uh the same acoustic event .__c3
__s__wi- - but uh - without any mark between the zone - of the overlapping zone with two speakers uh - speaking together .__c3
__b__and the zone with the three speakers .__c3
__fh__that would j- - just be one .__c1
__b__it - one one .__c3
__s__okay .__c1
__s^bd__uh - with uh - a beginning mark and the ending mark .__c3
__s^cs__got it .__c4
__s^cs__because uh - for me is the - is the zone with uh - some kind of uh - distortion the spectral .__c3
__s__i don't mind by the moment by the moment .__c3
__b__well but - | but you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two .__c8
__b__i - i don't ==__c3
__s__yeah but - uh - but uh i have to study what will happen in a general way .__c3
__%-__could .__c4
__s.%--__so you had to start somewhere .__c8
__b__yeah we just w- ==__c4
__s__i - i don't know what uh - will - will happen with the ==__c3
__b__so there's a lot of overlap .__c2
__b__yep .__c8
__s^t^tc.%--__so ==__c2
__s__that's a lot of overlap .__c8
__s__yeah ?__c8
__s__so again that's - that's three - three hundred in forty five minutes that are - that are speakers - just speakers .__c4
__fh|s__for forty five minutes .__c8
__s^e__yeah .__c3
__s^e__yeah .__c3
__s^rt__yeah .__c3
__s__uhhuh | okay yeah .__c4
__qy^rt__but a - a - a th- ==__c1
__h|%-__so that's about eight per minute .__c4
__s.%--__but a thousand events in twelve minutes that's ==__c1
__s^aa|s^cs__but ==__c3
__s^bk^rt__yeah .__c3
__s__but that can include taps .__c2
__b__uh - yeah .__c4
__s^ba__but ==__c3
__fh|qr__well | but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l- - in twelve minutes is a lot .__c1
__s^aa__general ==__c3
__s__actually ==__c2
__s^bk|s^ba__i - i con- - i consider - i consider acoustic events uh - the silent too .__c3
__s__silent .__c1
__b__silence starting or silence ending ?==__c8
__s__yeah silent ground .__c3
__s__to - bec- - to detect uh - because i consider acoustic  event all the things are not uh - speech .__c3
__fh|s__oh okay .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s^bu__oh .__c0
__s^aa__in ge- - in - in - in a general point of view .__c3
__s__oh .__c2
__s__okay | so how many of those thousand were silence ?__c4
__b__all right .__c2
__s.%__not speech - not speech or too much speech .__c5
__b__in the per- ==__c3
__s__too much speech .__c3
__s.%--__right .__c4
__s.%--__so how many of those thousand were silence - silent sections ?__c4
__fh__yeah .__c3
__qy^t1__w- - uh - silent .__c3
__s^ar^t1__i - i - i - i don't - i - i haven't the ==__c3
__s^rt__uh - i - i would like to - to do a stylistic study .__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__and give you uh - with the report uh - from uh - the - the study from the - the - the session - one session .__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__qw^rt__yeah .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__and i - i found that uh - another thing .__c3
__s^aa|s^na__when uh - uh i w- - i - i was uh - look at uh nnn - the difference speech file .__c3
__s__um - | for example uh - if uh we use the um - the mixed file to - to transcribe the - the events and the words i - i saw that uh - the uh - speech signal collected by the uh - this kind of mike - uh - of this kind of mike uh - are different from the uh mixed signal uh we uh - collected by headphone .__c3
__b__yep .__c8
__%-__right .__c8
__s^co__and it's right .__c3
__s.%-__yeah .__c4
__qy__but the problem is the following .__c3
__s__the - the - the ==__c3
__s^aa|s__i - i - i knew that uh - the signal uh - uh - would be different .__c3
__s__but uh - the - the problem is uh - uh - we uh - detected uh - difference events in the speech file uh - collected by - by that mike uh qui- - compared with the mixed file .__c3
__s^bk__and so if - when you transcribe uh - only uh - using the - nnn - the mixed file it's possible uh - if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system .__c3
__s^aa|s^na__it's possible you uh - in the uh ==__c3
__%--__i- - and you use the uh - speech file collected by the uh - fet mike to uh - to nnn - to do the experiments with the - the system .__c3
__fg|s.%-__uhhuh .__c4
__s__right .__c8
__s^e__its possible to evaluate uh uh or to consider uh - acoustic events that - which you marked uh - in the mixed file but uh - they don't appear in the uh - speech signal uh - collected by the - by the mike .__c3
__s.%--__right .__c8
__fh__the - the reason that i generated the mixed file was for i b m to do word level transcription not speech event transcription .__c8
__s__yeah .__c3
__%-__yeah oh it's a good idea .__c3
__b__it's a good idea i think .__c3
__s^bd|s__so i agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription that the mixed signals here .__c8
__%__yeah .__c3
__s__i mean - if i'm tapping on the table you - it's not going to show up on any of the mikes but it's going to show up rather loudly in the p z m .__c8
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__fh__so and i - i - i say uh - that uh - uh - or this uh - only because uh i c- - i - i - in my opinion - it's necessary to uh - to uh - to put the transcription on the speech file collected by the objective signal .__c3
__s.%-__so ==__c8
__s__i mean - the - the - the signal collected by the uh - the real mike in the future - in the prototype - to - to uh - correct the initial uh - segmentation uh - with the uh - real speech .__c3
__s^aap__uhhuh .__c4
__s^na__the - the - the far field .__c4
__s^aap^r__yeah .__c4
__s__and you have to - to analyze .__c3
__s__you have to - to process .__c3
__s^bk|s^t^tc__because i - i found a difference .__c3
__s^rt__yeah well just i mean - just in that - that one s- - ten second or whatever it was - example that adam had that - that we - we passed on to others a few months ago .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__there was that business where i g- - i guess it was adam and jane were talking at the same time .__c4
__s^ar__and - and uh - | in the close talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap and in the distant mike you could .__c4
__s^bk__so | yeah it's clear that if you want to study - if you want to find all the places where there were overlap it's probably better to use a distant mike .__c4
__s__that's good .__c5
__s__on the other hand there's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close talking mikes .__c4
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__so it's ==__c4
__b__but why can't you use the combination of the close talking mikes time aligned ?__c2
__s__if you use the combination of the close talking mikes you would hear jane interrupting me .__c8
__s__but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling .__c8
__s^bsc__and so if you're interested in ==__c8
__s^e__i - i mean - if you're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of non speech that's not a problem .__c2
__fh__s- - some of it's masking - masked .__c4
__s:s^bk__yeah .__c3
__s__were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you ?__c0
__s^fe^rt__right .__c4
__s__right .__c8
__s__right .__c2
__qy^rt__although the other issue is that the mixed close talking mikes ==__c8
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s^bu__i mean - i'm doing weird normalizations and things like that .__c8
__fh|s^aap__but it's known .__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__b__yep .__c8
__s__i mean - | the normalization you do is over the whole conversation .__c2
__b__right .__c8
__s^2__isn't it ?__c2
__b__over the whole meeting .__c2
__b__yep .__c8
__fh__so if you wanted to study people overlapping people that's not a problem .__c2
__s^cs__i - i - i think uh ==__c3
__s^ba__i saw the - nnn - the - uh ==__c3
__s.%--__but uh - i uh - i have uh - any results .__c3
__s__i - i - i saw the - the speech file collected by uh - the fet mike .__c3
__b__and uh - uh - | signal uh - to uh - to noise uh - relation is uh - low .__c3
__s^2__uhhuh .__c4
__s^bs__it's low .__c3
__qw^br__it's very low you would comp- - if we compare it with uh - the headphone .__c3
__s__yep .__c8
__s^bk__and ==__c3
__s^e__i - i found that nnn - that uh - um - pr- - probably ==__c3
__s__did - did you ?==__c8
__s^e__i'm not sure uh - by the moment .__c3
__fh.x__but it's it's probably that uh - a lot of uh - uh ==__c3
__fh__for example in the overlapping zone on uh - in - in several uh parts of the files where you - you can find uh - uh - uh - smooth uh - uh - speech uh - from uh - one uh - uh - talker in the - in the meeting .__c3
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c4
__s^e__uhhuh .__c4
__s^aa__it's probably in - in that uh - in - in those files you - you can not find - you can not process .__c3
__s^bk__because uh - it's confused with - with noise .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__fh__there are - a lot of ==__c3
__qrr__i think .__c3
__%-__but i have to study with more detail .__c3
__s^j__but uh - my idea is to - to process only nnn - this uh - nnn - this kind of s- - of uh - speech .__c3
__%-__because i think it's more realistic .__c3
__fg|s__i'm not sure it's a good idea but uh ==__c3
__s.%--__well it's more realistic but it'll - it'll be a lot harder .__c8
__s__no - i- ==__c4
__s^rt__well it'd be hard but on the other hand as you point out if your - if i- - if - if your concern is to get uh - the overlapping people - people's speech you will - you will get that somewhat better .__c4
__s^e__yeah .__c3
__b^rt__yeah .__c3
__b__um - | are you making any use ?==__c4
__s:s^ba__uh - | you were - you were working with th- - the data that had already been transcribed .__c4
__qh__does it uh ?==__c4
__b__with - by jane .__c3
__s^rt__yes .__c4
__s^rt__yeah .__c3
__s__now um - | did you make any use of that ?__c4
__b__see i was wondering because we st- - we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__do you ?==__c4
__qy^d^f^g^rt__the - the transcription by jane t- - uh - i- - uh - i - i - i want to use to - to nnn - uh - to put ==__c3
__fh__i- - i- - it's a reference for me .__c3
__x__but uh - the transcription uh - for example i - i don't - i - i'm not interested in the - in the - in the words - transcription words uh - transcribed uh - uh - in uh - follow in the - in the - in the speech file but uh - uh - jane uh - for example uh - put a mark uh - at the beginning uh - of each uh - talker .__c3
__s^aa__in the - in the meeting .__c3
__fh__um - uh - | she - she nnn - includes information about the zone where uh - there are - uh - there is an overlapping zone .__c3
__s^bu^rt__uhhuh .__c4
__qy^bu.%--__but uh -  there isn't any - any mark - time - temporal mark to - to c- - uh - to huh - e-heh - to label the beginning and the end of the - of the ==__c3
__%--__okay .__c4
__s^bu:s__right | so she is ==__c4
__s^aa|s^nd__i'm - i - i - i think uh - we need this information to ==__c3
__%-__right .__c4
__s^bk__so the twelve - you - you - it took you twelve hours - of course this included maybe some - some time where you were learning about what - what you wanted to do .__c4
__s.%--__but - but uh - it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty five minutes your ==__c4
__s^e__twelve minutes .__c8
__s^bk__twelve minutes .__c3
__s.%-__twelve minutes !__c4
__s__twelve minutes .__c3
__b__twelve .__c3
__s:s^fe__i thought you did forty five minutes of ==__c4
__b__no | forty five minutes is the - is the session .__c3
__s__all the session .__c3
__b__oh you haven't done the whole session .__c4
__fh__oh !__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__this is just twelve minutes .__c4
__s__all is the - the session .__c3
__fh__oh !__c4
__b__tw- - twelve - hours of work to - to segment uh - and label uh - twelve minutes from a session of part of f- ==__c3
__s^ba__so let me back up again .__c4
__b__so the - when you said there were three hundred speaker overlaps ==__c4
__s^ba__yeah .__c3
__s^df__that's in twelve minutes ?__c4
__b__no no no .__c3
__qy^d^f^g^rt__i - i consider all the - all the session because uh i - i count the - nnn - the - nnn - the overlappings marked by - by jane .__c3
__s^bk__oh okay .__c4
__s^ba__okay .__c4
__b__oh i see .__c1
__s^df__in - in - in - in the fin- - in - in the forty five minutes .__c3
__b__so it's three hundred in forty five minutes .__c4
__s__but you have - you have time uh - uh - marked twelve minute the - the - the um - overlaps in twelve minutes of it .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^bk^rt^tc__got it .__c4
__s^t^tc__well not just the overlaps everything .__c8
__qy^d^g^rt__so - | can i ask - can i ask whether you found uh - you know - how accurate uh - jane's uh - uh - labels were as far as ?==__c5
__s__you know - did she miss some overlaps or did she ?==__c5
__fh|s^t1__but by - by the moment i - i don't compare my - my temporal mark with uh - jane but uh - i - i want to do it .__c3
__s^t1__because uh - uh - i- - per- - perhaps i have uh - errors in the - in the marks .__c3
__fg|qw__i - and if i - i - compare with uh jane it's probably i - i - i can correct and - and - and to get uh uh a more accurately uh uh transcription in the file .__c3
__b__yeah .__c4
__%__well also jane - jane was doing word level .__c8
__s__yeah .__c4
__s.%-__so we weren't concerned with exactly when an overlap started and stopped .__c8
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^e__right right .__c5
__s^aa|s^m__i'm expect- - i'm not expecting ==__c5
__s^bk__well ==__c3
__s^e__well | not only a word level but actually ==__c2
__qy^d^f^g__i mean - | you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption .__c2
__b__no | it's ==__c3
__s^e__you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt or ==__c2
__s__right .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__yep .__c8
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__well ==__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__well yeah b- - yeah i would say time bin .__c1
__s__so my - my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin beginning and end point .__c1
__s^rt__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c3
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__s^cs__right .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s.%--__and - and sometimes you know - it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle .__c1
__s__but yeah w- - it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that i- - disrupt that unit in order to have you know a- - the words in the order in which they were spoken .__c1
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__s__it would have - it would have been hard with the interface that we have .__c1
__s^2.%--__right .__c8
__s^2__now my - a- - adam's working on a - of course - on a revised overlapping interface .__c1
__%-__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk__i - i - i think - it's - it's a good uh - work .__c3
__s^2__but ==__c1
__b__but uh i think we need uh - uh - more information .__c3
__s__no of course .__c5
__s__i expect you to find more overlaps than - than jane .__c5
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^bu__always need more for ==__c8
__fh__no - no - i - i have to go to ==__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c1
__s^bk__because you're looking at it at a much more detailed level .__c5
__b__i want uh - i wanted to uh - compare the - the transcription .__c3
__fg|s__but if it takes sixty to one ==__c8
__s__i have ==__c4
__s.%--__well i - but i have a suggestion about that .__c4
__fh__um - | obviously this is very very time consuming and you're finding lots of things .__c4
__s__which i'm sure are going to be very interesting .__c4
__s^ba__but in the interests of making progress uh - might i s- ==__c4
__s__how - how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps ?__c4
__fh__only .__c3
__s__yes .__c4
__qr__do not mark any other events .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__but only mark speaker .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ?__c4
__s__okay  .__c3
__qy__okay i - i - i - i w- - i - i wanted to ==__c3
__s^aa|s__do y- - do you think that would speed it up ?__c4
__s^bk__uh - | speed up your - your - your marking ?__c4
__s__nnn i don't understand very ==__c3
__s.%-__it took you a long time to mark twelve minutes .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__b.%__oh yeah yeah .__c3
__s^bk__now my suggestion was for the other thirty three ==__c4
__s__on- - only to mark - only to mark overlapping zone but ==__c3
__s^t1__yeah | and my question is if you did that - if you followed my suggestion - would it take much less time ?__c4
__s__oh .__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah okay .__c4
__s.%--__sure .__c3
__s__yeah sure .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__then i think it's a good idea .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__then i think it's a good idea because it- ==__c4
__s.%-__sure sure .__c3
__s^aa|s^aap__sure .__c3
__s^bk__because i - i need a lot of time to - to put the label or to do that .__c3
__s^aap__yeah .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah i mean - we - we know that there's noise .__c4
__qrr__and- ==__c8
__s^bk|%-__uhhuh .__c3
__qy^e^rt__there's - there's uh - continual noise uh - from fans and so forth .__c4
__qrr.%--__and there is uh - more impulsive noise from uh - taps and so forth .__c4
__s^ar__yeah .__c3
__s__and - and something in between with paper rustling .__c4
__b__we know that all that's there .__c4
__b__and it's a g- - worthwhile thing to study .__c4
__qy^d^f^g^rt__but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__whereas th- - i- - i would think that uh - you - we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s.%--__okay .__c3
__s.%--__so - | then you can get the - because you need ==__c4
__s.%--__okay .__c3
__s^co__if it's three hundred uh - i- - i- - it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really ==__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__s.%--__and - and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh - even visual sense of - of what's going on much less any kind of reasonable statistics .__c4
__fh__right .__c8
__s__now why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the ?==__c2
__s.%--__well that's ==__c8
__qw__that's what i was going to bring up .__c8
__s^fe^t^tc__i mean - you shouldn't need to do this p- - completely by hand .__c2
__s.%--__um - | okay yeah - so let's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation .__c4
__s^cs__right ?__c2
__%__i'm sorry .__c2
__s|s.%-__so the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures .__c4
__s__such as the increase in energy such as the energy in the l p c residuals such as ==__c4
__s__i mean - there's a bunch of things - i mean- - increased energy is - -is sort of an obvious one .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s^bk__in the far field mike .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__oh okay .__c2
__b__um - and uh - | it's not obvious .__c4
__s.%-__i mean - you could - you could do the dumbest thing and get - get it ninety percent of the time .__c4
__s^bu.%-__but when you start going past that and trying to do better it's not obvious what combination of features is going to give you the - you know - the right detector .__c4
__s^aa__so the idea is to have some ground truth first .__c4
__s__and so the i- - the idea of the manual marking was to say okay this i- - you know - it's - it's really here .__c4
__b__but i think liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts .__c0
__s^e__what i mean is - get it from the close talking mikes .__c2
__b__uh - | yeah .__c4
__b__a- - or ge- - get a first pass from those .__c2
__%--__we t- - we t- - w- - we t- - we talked about that .__c4
__s^2__and then go through sort of ==__c2
__b__it'd be a lot faster probably to ==__c2
__b__and you can ==__c5
__s^ba^fe__yeah that's his - uh ==__c8
__fg|s__we - we - we talked about that .__c4
__b__but so it's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is ==__c4
__b__yeah | i just ==__c2
__b__the idea was i- - we i- - i- - we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway .__c4
__qy^d^f^g^rt__and - and then whatever he could mark would be helpful .__c4
__qw__right .__c2
__qy^e^rt__and we could - uh ==__c4
__s^bk|qy^rt__it's a question of what you bootstrap from .__c4
__s.%--__you know - do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g- - do better ?__c4
__s.%--__or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then then do your simple measurements uh - from the close talking mike ?__c4
__fh__i mean - even with the close talking mike you're not going to get it right all the time .__c4
__s__well that's what i wonder because um ==__c2
__s.%--__or how bad it is .__c2
__s__well ==__c4
__s.%--__i'm working on a program to do that and ==__c8
__s.%--__be- - um - | because that would be interesting .__c2
__s^rt__especially because the bottleneck is the transcription .__c2
__b__right ?__c2
__s.%-__i mean - we've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for .__c2
__s__we have the audio data .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__we have the close talking mike .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__so i mean - it seems like one kind of project ==__c2
__s^aa__that's not perfect but ==__c2
__s.%--__um - | that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is - you know ==__c2
__s.%--__if you infer form the close talking mikes where the on off points are of speech .__c2
__s.%--__right | we discussed that .__c4
__s__you know - | how can we detect that from a far field ?__c2
__fg|s.%--__and ==__c8
__s^fa|s^df.%--__oh .__c1
__fh__i've - i've written a program to do that .__c8
__s__okay .__c2
__s__and - it - uh ==__c8
__s.%--__i'm sorry i missed the ==__c2
__s__it's okay .__c4
__s^bk^m__and - so | but it's - it's doing something very very simple .__c8
__b__it just takes a threshold based on - on the volume .__c8
__qy^bu^d^rt__uhhuh .__c2
__qy.%-__or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand .__c5
__s^ar__right .__c2
__s__by hand yeah .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__s__um | and then it does a median filter and then it looks for runs .__c8
__b__and it seems to work .__c8
__s.%-__i've - i'm sort of fiddling with the parameters to get it to actually generate something .__c8
__s^bk|s.%-__and i haven't ==__c8
__s^aa__i don't - what i'm working on - was working on - was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have - into transcriber .__c8
__%--__and so - | i told - i said it would take about a day .__c8
__b__i've worked on it for about half a day .__c8
__s^aa__i have to go .__cb
__s.%--__so | give me another half day and i- - we'll have something we can play with .__c8
__s.%--__okay .__c2
__s^df__see this is where we really need the meeting recorder query stuff to be working .__c4
__s__because we've had these meetings and we've had this discussion about this and i'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided .__c4
__s^bk__right .__c2
__s__i'm sorry !__c2
__b^rt__i just ==__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__but i couldn't remember all of it .__c4
__s__it ==__c2
__s^cs__so | i think it was partly that you know - give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like partly that we have e- - some ground truth to compare against you know - when - when he - he gets his thing going .__c4
__s^cs^e__but ==__c8
__s^bk__uh - | and ==__c4
__s__well it's definitely good to have somebody look at it .__c2
__s^bk__i was just thinking as a way to speed up you know - the amount of ==__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__but that was - that was exactly the notion that - that - that we discussed .__c4
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__s^bu.%-__okay .__c2
__s^aa__thanks .__c8
__s^bk|s__another thing we discussed was - um - that ==__c1
__s^bk|s__so ==__c4
__qw^br__it looks good .__c2
__s^bk__i'll be in touch .__c2
__b__thanks .__c2
__s__s- - see ya .__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__b__was that um - there m- - there was this already a script i believe uh - that dan had written - that uh - handle bleedthrough .__c1
__fg__i mean - | because you have this - this close - you have contamination from other people who speak loudly .__c1
__fg|s__yeah .__c8
__s__and i haven't tried using that .__c8
__s__it would probably help the program that i'm doing to first feed it through that .__c8
__qy^d^f^g__it's a cross correlation filter .__c8
__s__so i - i haven't tried that but that - if - it - it might be something - it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little .__c8
__s.%--__so some thought of maybe having ==__c1
__s__having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours .__c1
__qr__exactly yep .__c8
__s^aa__but - but that's a refinement .__c4
__s^bk__that's what we were discussing .__c1
__s__and i think we want to see - try the simple thing first .__c4
__s^bk__because you add this complex thing up uh - afterwards that does something good y- - y- - yo- - you sort of want to see what the simple thing does first .__c4
__s^co__yep .__c8
__qw.%-__but uh - having - having somebody have some experience again with - with uh - with marking it from a human standpoint .__c4
__qw^br__we're - i mean - i don't expect jose to - to do it for uh - f- - fifty hours of - of speech .__c4
__s^bk|s.%--__but i mean we - if uh - if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it say for forty five minutes then at least we'd have three hundred examples of it .__c4
__s^rt__sure .__c3
__b__sure .__c3
__b__and when - when uh - adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different .__c4
__s__oh yeah definitely .__c2
__s.%--__you know i did - i did uh - something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs and it works pretty well .__c0
__fh|s.%--__i mean - i- - almost exactly what you described an energy detector with a median filter you look for runs .__c0
__s^bsc.%--__and uh ==__c0
__s__you know - you can ==__c0
__s__it seemed like the right thing to do .__c8
__s.%--__yeah | i mean - you - you can get y- - i mean - you get them pretty close .__c0
__s__that was with zero literature search .__c8
__s.%--__and so i think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to - to do it .__c0
__s^bs__that's good validation .__c8
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__is this proprietary ?__c1
__b__yeah do you have a patent on it ?__c8
__b__uh - | no no .__c0
__b__it was when i was working for the government .__c0
__s__oh | then everybody owns it .__c4
__qh__it's the people .__c4
__b__well i mean is this something that we could just co opt ?__c1
__qh__or is it ?==__c1
__b__no .__c1
__s__nah .__c0
__qr__okay .__c1
__s__well i - i- - i- - he's pretty close anyway i think - i think it's ==__c4
__b__yeah he's - it - it doesn't take a long time .__c0
__s.%--__right .__c1
__s__i just thought if it was tried and true then and he's gone through additional levels of - of development .__c1
__s__just output .__c8
__s__although if you - if you have some parameters like - what's a good window size for the median filter ?__c8
__b__oh | i have to remember .__c0
__fh|qy__i'll think about it .__c0
__b__and try to remember .__c0
__s__and it might be different for government people .__c5
__s.%-__that's all right .__c8
__%--__yeah good enough for government work as they say .__c4
__qw^bu.%--__they - they ==__c2
__b__di- - dif- - different - different bandwidth .__c0
__s^bd__they ==__c5
__s^df__i was doing pretty short you know - tenth of a second sorts of numbers .__c8
__s^fa__okay .__c5
__s^bk__uh - | i don't know it - if - if we want to uh ==__c4
__fh|s__so uh - | maybe we should move on to other - other things in limited time .__c4
__s.%-__can i ask one question about his statistics ?__c1
__s^aa__so - so in the tw- - twelve minutes um - if we took three hundred and divided it by four which is about the length of twelve minutes i- - um i'd expect like there should be seventy five overlaps .__c1
__fh|s__yeah .__c4
__s^rt__did you find - uh - more than seventy five overlaps in that period or ?==__c1
__b__more than ?__c3
__s__more than ==__c1
__b__how many overlaps in your twelve minutes ?__c1
__b__how many ?__c3
__s__uh not i- ==__c3
__b__onl- - only i - i transcribe uh - only twelve minutes from the ==__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__but uh - | i - i don't co- - uh - i don't count uh - the - the overlap .__c3
__s^rt__the overlaps .__c1
__s^ba__okay .__c1
__b__i consider i - i - the - the nnn - the - the three hundred is uh - considered only you - your transcription .__c3
__s__i have to - to finish transcribing .__c3
__s.%-__so ==__c3
__fg__i b- - i bet they're more because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than - than sort of the middle .__c8
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__middle or end .__c8
__fh__yeah .__c3
__%-__because i- - we're - we're dealing with the uh - in the early meetings .__c8
__s__i'm not sure .__c1
__s^df__we're recording while we're saying who's talking on what microphone and things like that .__c8
__s^ba__yeah .__c3
__s__and that seems to be a lot of overlap .__c8
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__i think it's an empirical question .__c1
__s__i think we could find that out .__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__yep .__c8
__s__i'm - i'm not sure that the beginning had more .__c1
__qy__so - so i was going to ask i guess - about any - any other things that - that - that either of you wanted to talk about .__c4
__s.%__especially since andreas is leaving in five minutes .__c4
__s^e__that - that you want to go with .__c4
__s__can i just ask about the data ?__c2
__s^bk__like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data ?__c2
__s__just because i'm ==__c2
__s^rt__i wanted to get a feel for that .__c2
__s__to sort of be able to know what - what can be done first .__c2
__b__and like how many meetings are we recording ?__c2
__s__right | so there's this - this - there's this forty five minute piece that jane transcribed .__c4
__s__and ==__c2
__s__that piece was then uh - sent to i b m so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point .__c4
__s^bk__then there's s- - a larger piece that's been recorded and uh - put on c d rom and sent uh - to i b m .__c4
__b__right ?__c4
__b__and then - we don't know .__c4
__b__how many meetings is that ?__c2
__b__what's that ?__c8
__s__like how many ?==__c2
__b^rt__that was about ten hours and there was about ==__c4
__b__t- - ten - it's like ten meetings or something ?__c2
__b__yeah something like that .__c8
__s^bu__uhhuh .__c2
__s^aa__and then - then we ==__c8
__%-__ten meetings that have been sent to i b m ?__c0
__s^aa__and ==__c2
__fh|s__well i haven't sent them yet because i was having this problem with the missing files .__c8
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__oh .__c4
__s^df__oh | that's right that had - those have not been sent .__c4
__%__h- - how many total have we recorded now altogether ?__c0
__b__we're saying about twelve hours .__c4
__s^e__about twelve by now twelve or thirteen .__c8
__qy^d^f^g^rt__and we're recording only this meeting like continuously .__c2
__fg|qy__we're only recording this one now or ?==__c2
__s__no .__c4
__b__nope .__c8
__fh__no | so the - the - that's the - that's the biggest one uh - chunk so far .__c4
__s^e__okay .__c2
__s^e__it was the morning one .__c0
__s^aa__but there's at least one meeting recorded of uh - the uh - uh - natural language guys .__c4
__s__jerry .__c8
__s.%-__do they meet every week ?__c2
__fh|s.%--__and then there ==__c4
__s^ar__uh - | they do .__c4
__s__or - every ?==__c2
__s__w- - w- - and we talked to them about recording some more .__c4
__s^am__and we're going to ==__c4
__s^ba__uh - | we've started having a morning meeting today uh - i- - starting a w- - a week or two ago on the uh front end issues .__c4
__s^df.%--__and we're recording those .__c4
__s^df__uh - | there's a network services and applications group here who's agreed to have their meetings recorded .__c4
__b__great .__c2
__s^cs__and we're going to start recording them .__c4
__b.%__they're - they meet on tuesdays we're going to start recording them next week .__c4
__s__so actually we're going to h- - start having a - a pretty significant chunk .__c4
__s__and ==__c4
__b.%__so you know - | adam's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff - things like that .__c4
__s__now that uh - the - things are starting to happen .__c4
__s:qy__so right now yeah i th- - i'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings .__c4
__s__but there are scattered other meetings in it and that - that amount is going to grow .__c4
__s__uh - so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately ==__c4
__qy^d^f^g^rt__i- - if we're - if we collect fifty or sixty hours the meeting meetings it will probably be you know - twenty or thirty percent of it .__c4
__s.%--__not - not - not eighty or ninety .__c4
__s.%--__but ==__c4
__qy^d^f^g^rt__so there's probably - there's three to four a week .__c2
__qy.%-__that's what we're aiming for .__c8
__s^aa__that we're aiming for .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__s^bu__and they're each about an hour or something .__c2
__s^aa|s__yeah yeah .__c4
__s^aa__although ==__c8
__qw.%--__yeah .__c8
__s^j__we'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not .__c8
__qy__so ==__c2
__s^ba__yeah and th- - the - the other thing is i'm not pos- ==__c4
__qw.%-__okay .__c2
__qw^br__i'm sort of thinking as we've been through this a few times that i really don't know ==__c4
__s^rt__maybe you want to do it once for the novelty .__c4
__s^co__but i don't know if in general we want to have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits .__c4
__s^cs.%-__right .__c8
__s^j__because it's just an added bunch of weird stuff .__c4
__s^fa__yeah .__c2
__%-__and you know - | we - we h- - we're highly motivated .__c4
__b__uh - in fact the morning group is really motivated .__c4
__s^cs__because they're working on connected digits .__c4
__%__so it's ==__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__actually that's something i wanted to ask .__c8
__fh|s^rt__is i have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits .__c8
__s^t1__yeah .__c4
__s__we don't have to hand transcribe the digits because we're reading them and i have those .__c8
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__and so i have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance .__c8
__fg__right .__c2
__qy.%--__but i haven't been ru- - i haven't been doing that .__c8
__s__um - | if i did that - is someone going to be working on it ?__c8
__s__uh - | yeah i- - i think .__c4
__s__i mean - is it something of interest ?__c8
__b__definitely s- - so- - absolutely .__c4
__s__yeah | whoever we have working on the acoustics for the meeting recorder are going to start with that .__c4
__s^ba__okay .__c8
__s.%-__i mean - i- - i'm - i'm interested in it .__c8
__s^bd__i just don't have time to do it now .__c8
__fh__i was - these meetings - i'm sure someone thought of this but these - this uh - reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um - adaptation .__c5
__h__so ==__c8
__s.%-__yep yep .__c8
__s__um ==__c5
__s^bk__actually i have o- ==__c2
__s__i - i would really like someone to do adaptation .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__so if we got someone interested in that i think it would be great for meeting recorder .__c8
__s__well ==__c4
__qy^d^f^g^rt__i mean - one of the things i wanted to do uh that i - i talked to - to don about is one of the possible things he could do or m- - also we could have someone else do it - is to do block echo cancellation .__c4
__b^rt__since it's the same people over and over .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk__to try to get rid of some of the effects of the - the - the far field effects .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s^ar|%--__um - | i mean - we have - the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation .__c4
__qy^bh__because people move around .__c4
__s^aa__and uh - | if - if it's - if it's uh - not a simple echo like a cross talk kind of echo but it's actually room acoustics it's - it's - it's - you can't really do inversion .__c4
__s^df__uhhuh .__c5
__s.%--__and even echo cancellation is going to uh - be something - it may you - someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly .__c4
__s__and so the tack that we've taken is more lets come up with feature approaches and multi stream approaches and so forth that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal .__c4
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk__uh - | that's the party line .__c4
__b__but it occurred to me a few months ago that uh - party lines are always you know - sort of dangerous .__c4
__fg__it's good - good to sort of test them actually .__c4
__s__and so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do .__c4
__s__so | that's something i'd like somebody to do at some point just take these digits take the far field mike signal and the close uh - mike signal and apply really good echo cancellation .__c4
__s__um - | there was a - have been some nice talks recently by - by lucent on - on their - b- ==__c4
__b__huh .__c5
__s__the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me .__c4
__s__uh - | you know - trying and change it sample by sample but you have some reasonable sized blocks and um - you know - th- ==__c4
__s__w- - what is the um - the artifact you try to - you're trying to get rid of when you do that ?__c0
__b__ciao .__c5
__s^e.%--__uh - | so it's - it - you have a - a direct uh ==__c4
__s^bd__what's the difference in - if you were trying to construct a linear filter that would ?==__c4
__%--__um ==__c4
__s__i'm signing off .__c5
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__that would subtract off the um - uh - parts of the signal that were - the aspects of the signal that were different between the close talk and the distant .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__you know so - so uh - um - | i guess in most echo cancellation .__c4
__fh__yeah - | so you - given that um ==__c4
__b__yeah | so you're trying to - so you'd - there's a - a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there's a time delay there .__c4
__b__and after the time delay there's these various reflections .__c4
__fh__and if you figure out well what's the ==__c4
__fg|s__there's a - a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself - adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract - essentially to subtract off uh - different uh - different reflections .__c4
__s.%-__right so let's take the simple case where you just had - you had some uh - some delay in a satellite connection or something .__c4
__s.%-__and then there's a - there's an echo .__c4
__s.%-__it comes back and you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .__c4
__b__so that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those .__c0
__s^e__uh - | just the raw data .__c0
__b__you would - you might hear kind of an echo ?__c0
__fg|s__and - and then this noise cancellation would get- ==__c0
__s^e__well i'm - i'm - i'm saying that's a simplified version of what's really happening - what's really happening is ==__c4
__s^aa__well when i'm talking to you right now - you're getting the direct sound from my speech .__c4
__s^aa|s^ba^na__but you're also getting uh - the indirect sound that's bounced around the room a number of times .__c4
__s__okay ?__c4
__s^bk__so now if you um - try to - r- - you - to completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons .__c4
__s__but i - but ==__c4
__b__not to try to completely remove it - that is invert the - the room response .__c4
__b__but just to try to uh - uh - eliminate some of the - the effect of some of the echos .__c4
__qh^rt__um | a number of people have done this .__c4
__s__so that say if you're talking to a speakerphone uh - it makes it more like it would be if you were talking right up to it .__c4
__b__so this is sort of the st- - the straight forward approach .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__you say i - i - i want to use this uh - this item but i want to subtract off various kinds of echos .__c4
__s__so you construct a filter and you have this - this filtered version uh - of the speech um - gets uh - uh - gets subtracted off from the original speech .__c4
__s__then you try to - you try to minimize the energy in some sense .__c4
__s__and so um - uh - | with some constraints .__c4
__b__kind of a clean up thing that ==__c0
__b__it's a clean up thing right .__c4
__s__okay .__c0
__b__so | echo cancelling is - is you know - commonly done in telephony .__c4
__b__and - and - and - | it's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you - if you know - you're going to be talking some distance from a mike .__c4
__s__when uh - i would have meetings with the folks in cambridge when i was at b b n over the phone they had a um - some kind of a special speaker phone .__c0
__b__and when they would first connect me it would come on and we'd hear all this noise .__c0
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__b.%__and then it was uh - and then it would come on and it was very clear .__c0
__s^cs__you know ?__c0
__b__right | so it's taking samples it's doing adaptation it's adjusting weights .__c4
__b__and then it's getting the sum .__c4
__s__so um - uh - | anyway that's - that's kind of a reasonable thing that i'd like to have somebody try .__c4
__%--__somebody look - and - and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with .__c4
__s^ba__i think that'd be enough data - plenty of data to do that with .__c4
__s.%--__and i- - for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh - large vocabulary speech or anything .__c4
__b__uh um ==__c4
__b__is brian kingsbury's work related to that ?__c1
__s__or is it a different type of reverberation ?__c1
__s:qy__brian's kingsbury's work is an example of what we did f- - f- - from the opposite dogma .__c4
__s.%-__right ?__c4
__s:s__which is what i was calling the party line which is that - uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want .__c4
__s^ng__we want something more flexible uh - i- - i- - where people might change their position .__c4
__b__and there might be you know ==__c4
__s^bd__there's also um ==__c4
__b__oh yeah !__c4
__s^bk|%-__noise .__c4
__s^bk__so the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise .__c4
__s.%--__it's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays .__c4
__b__then we'll figure out the right - the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those - those echos .__c4
__s^df__but um - | if there's noise then the very signal that it's looking at is corrupted .__c4
__b__so that it's decision about what the right - you know right - right uh - delays are is uh - is - right delayed signal is - is - is uh - is incorrect .__c4
__s:s__and so in a noisy situation um - also in a - in a situation that's very reverberant - with long reverberation times and really long delays it's - it's sort of typically impractical .__c4
__b__so for those kind of reasons ==__c4
__s__and also a - a c- - a complete inversion ==__c4
__s__if you actually - i mentioned that it's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics .__c4
__b__um - | that's difficult because um - often times the - the um - the system transfer function is such that when it's inverted you get something that's unstable .__c4
__%--__and so if you - you do your estimate of what the system is and then you try to invert it you get a filter that actually uh - you know - rings and - and uh goes to infinity .__c4
__s__so it's - so there's - there's - there's that sort of technical reason and the fact that things move and there's air currents .__c4
__b^rt__i mean - there's all sorts of - all sorts of reasons why it's not really practical .__c4
__b__so for all those kinds of reasons uh - we - we - we sort of um - concluded we didn't want to in- - do inversion .__c4
__b__and we're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation which isn't really inversion .__c4
__b__and um - | we decided to do this approach of taking - uh - just picking uh - features which were uh - will give you more - something that was more stable in the presence of or absence of room reverberation .__c4
__%--__and that's what brian was trying to do .__c4
__s__so um - | let me just say a couple things that i was - i was going to bring up .__c4
__b__uh - | let's see - i guess you - you actually already said this thing about the uh - about the consent forms .__c4
__b__which was that we now don't have to ==__c4
__b__so this was the human subjects folks who said this or that - that ?==__c4
__%-__the a- - apparently i mean - we're going to do a revised form - of course .__c1
__b__um ==__c1
__%--__but once a person has signed it once then that's valid for a certain number of meetings .__c1
__s^rt__she wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form .__c1
__s__i told her that would be a little bit difficult to say .__c1
__s^bu__so i think from a s- - practical standpoint maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings or something .__c1
__qr^bu.%--__it won't be that many people who do it that often .__c1
__fh__but um - just - you know - | so long as they don't forget that they've done it i guess .__c1
__s__okay .__c4
__qy^rt.%-__um - | back on the data thing .__c4
__s^bk__so there's this sort of one hour ten hour a hundred hour sort of thing that - that we have .__c4
__b__we have - we have an hour uh - that - that is transcribed .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__we have - we have twelve hours that's recorded but not transcribed .__c4
__b__and at the rate we're going uh - by the end of the semester we'll have i don't know forty or fifty or something if we - if this really .__c4
__s__uh ==__c4
__s__well do we have that much ?__c4
__qr^rt__not really .__c2
__fh__let's see .__c4
__s__we have ==__c4
__fh__it's three to four per week .__c2
__s__so | that's what - you know - that ==__c2
__s^rt__uh - | eight weeks uh - is ==__c4
__s^rt__so that's not a lot of hours .__c2
__s__eight weeks times three hours is twenty four so that's - yeah so like thirty - thirty hours .__c4
__s^rt__three - three hours .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s^am__i mean - is there ?==__c2
__qy^rt__i know this sounds tough but we've got the room set up .__c2
__s__um - | i was starting to think of some projects where you would use ==__c2
__s^aa__well | similar to what we talked about with uh - energy detection on the close talking mikes .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__there are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting that don't require any transcription .__c2
__fh__so what are the patterns - the energy patterns over the meeting ?__c2
__%-__and i'm really interested in this but we don't have a whole lot of data .__c2
__qh__so i was thinking you know - we've got the room set up .__c2
__s.%-__and | you can always think of - also for political reasons - if icsi collected you know - two hundred hours that looks different than forty hours even if we don't transcribe it ourselves .__c2
__s^ar__but i don't think we're going to stop at the end of this semester .__c4
__s__so ==__c2
__fh|qy.%-__right ?__c4
__s__so i th- - i think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months we are going to have more like a hundred hours .__c4
__s__especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them or some kind of deci- ==__c2
__fh__i mean - that are less ==__c2
__s__well | i don't ==__c2
__fh|s__uh - | that have some more emotional aspects to them ?__c2
__s__or strong ?==__c2
__s__we had some good ones earlier .__c8
__b__there's laughter .__c2
__s__um - i'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings .__c2
__fh|s__maybe with manager types or ==__c2
__s__i think it's hard to record those .__c8
__fg__to be allowed to record them ?__c2
__%-__yeah | people will get ==__c4
__s.%--__okay .__c2
__%--__it's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .__c1
__s.%--__but i - but i wanted to raise the k p f a idea .__c1
__s^bd^no__okay .__c2
__s.%--__well if there is any way .__c2
__s__yeah i was going to mention that .__c4
__%--__oh that's a good idea .__c8
__s__that's - that would be a good match .__c8
__s^df__yeah so - yeah so i - i uh - i - i'd mentioned to adam and that was another thing i was going to talk uh - mention to them before that uh - there's uh - it - it oc- - it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh - acquaintances in local broadcast media .__c4
__s^df.%-__because you know - we had talked before about the problem about using found data that - that uh - it's just set up however they have it set up .__c4
__b__and we don't have any say about it .__c4
__s^bk|s^bu__and it's typically one microphone .__c4
__s^br^m.%--__in a - uh - uh - or - and - and so it doesn't really give us the - the - the uh - characteristics we want .__c4
__s^no.%-__um - | and so i do think we're going to continue recording here and record what we can .__c4
__s__but um - | it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say hey you have this panel show or this you know - this discussion show and um - can you record multi channel .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__and uh - | they may be willing to record it uh - with ==__c4
__s__lapel mikes or something ?__c2
__s^aa__well they probably already use lapel .__c4
__qh__but they might be able to have it - it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .__c4
__s__right .__c2
__qw__it wouldn't be exactly this setup but it would be that sort of thing .__c4
__s__and what we were going to get from u w you know - assuming they - they - they start recording isn't als- - also is not going to be this exact setup .__c4
__b__no i think that'd be great .__c2
__b__so i - i - i - i was thinking of looking into that .__c4
__s__if we can get more data .__c2
__s__the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion in fact is that it's even possible since of course many radio shows are not live uh - that we could invite them to have like some of their - record some of their shows here .__c4
__s__wow !__c1
__s__well or - | the thing is they're not as averse to wearing one of these head mount  ==__c2
__qy^d^f^g^rt__right as we are .__c8
__s^aa__i mean they're on the radio .__c2
__s__right ?__c2
__s.%--__so um - | i think that'd be fantastic .__c2
__s^bd__right .__c4
__s.%--__because those kinds of panels and those have interesting ==__c2
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s__th- - that's an - a side of - style - a style that we're not collecting here .__c2
__s__so ==__c2
__b__and - and the - i mean the other side to it was the - what - which is where we were coming from - i'll - i'll talk to you more about it later is that - is that there's - there's uh ==__c4
__qy^d^f^g^rt__it'd be great .__c2
__s^aa.%__the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably uh - related to you know - legal issues and - and permissions and all that .__c4
__s.%-:s.%-__i mean - they already do what they do - do whatever they do .__c4
__s^cs__so it's - uh - it's - so it's - so it's another source .__c4
__b__so i think it's something we should look into .__c4
__s^aa__you know we'll collect what we collect here .__c4
__s^cs__hopefully they will collect more at u w also .__c4
__s__and um - | and maybe we have this other source .__c4
__s.%--__but yeah i think that it's not unreasonable to aim at getting you know significantly in excess of a hundred hours .__c4
__b.%__i mean - that was sort of our goal .__c4
__s^bu__the thing was i was hoping that we could in the - under this controlled situation - we could at least collect you know - thirty to fifty hours .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__and at the rate we're going we'll get pretty close to that i think this semester .__c4
__s__and if we continue to collect some next semester i think we should uh ==__c4
__s__right .__c2
__qw__yeah i was mostly trying to think - okay if you start a project within say a month you know - how much data do you have to work with .__c2
__s^e__and you - you want to s- - you want to sort of fr- - freeze your - your data for awhile .__c2
__s__so um - | right now ==__c2
__b__and we don't have the transcripts back yet from i b m .__c2
__s^df__right ?__c2
__s__well we don't even have it for this f- - you know forty five minutes that was ==__c4
__b__do - oh do we now ?==__c2
__s__so um - | not complaining i was just trying to think you know - what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh - six months from now .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__and they're pretty different because ==__c2
__s__right .__c8
__s.%--__yeah so i was thinking right now it's sort of this exploratory stuff where you - you look at the data you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like .__c4
__s.%-__um ==__c2
__s^bk__right .__c2
__s^fa__and - and - and uh - and meanwhile we collect and it's more like yeah three months from now or six months from now you can - you can do a lot of other things .__c4
__s__right right .__c2
__s.%-__because i'm not actually sure just logistically that i can spend ==__c2
__s.%-__you know - i don't want to charge the time that i have on the project too early before there's enough data to make good use of the time .__c2
__b__and that's - and especially with the student ==__c2
__s__right .__c8
__s^ar|s^nd__uh - for instance this guy who seems .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s^ar__uh ==__c2
__s__anyway i shouldn't say too much .__c2
__s__but um - | if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring how much data will i have to work with with that person ?__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__and so it's ==__c2
__b__i- - yeah so i would think exploratory things now uh - three months from now ==__c4
__fg__um - | i mean - the transcriptions i think are a bit of an unknown because we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing .__c4
__b__but i think as far as the collection - it doesn't seem to me l- - like uh - unreasonable to say that uh - in january you know ro- - roughly uh - which is roughly three months from now - we should have at least something like you know - twenty five thirty hours .__c4
__fg__and we just don't know about the transcription part of that .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__so that's ==__c4
__s__yeah we need to - i think that there's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards .__c1
__s__so ==__c2
__s__i mean - it ==__c2
__s__and uh - es- - especially since these people won't be uh - used to dealing with multi channel uh - transcriptions .__c1
__fg|%-__right .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah .__c4
__qrr__so i think that we'll need to adjust some .__c1
__qrr.%--__and also if we want to add things like um - well more refined coding of overlaps then definitely i think we should count on having an extra pass through .__c1
__h|s__i wanted to ask another a- - a- - aspect of the data collection .__c1
__s^ar|s.%-__there'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh - you know - friends .__c1
__s^arp^df__and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to .__c1
__s^cs__right ?__c1
__s^aa__if they really have something they want to talk about as opposed to something uh ==__c4
__s^cs^e__i mean - what we're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions .__c4
__qh__but i think if it's a real ==__c4
__b^rt__why not ?__c4
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__i mean - i'm thinking politically .__c2
__s.%--__stage some political debates .__c8
__b__you could do this .__c1
__s.%--__well | yeah .__c2
__s^2^cs__you know - you could .__c1
__%-__or just if you're - if you ha- - if there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't um - have them do the digits or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing like if it was you know - uh - one string of digits or something they'd probably be willing to do .__c2
__s^aa^m__we don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to .__c8
__s__then having the data is very valuable .__c2
__qy^d^f^g^rt__because i think it's um - politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data especially with the i t r if we put in a proposal on it .__c2
__s^aa__it'll just look like icsi's collected a lot more audio data .__c2
__s^e__um - | whether it's transcribed or not um - is another issue .__c2
__b^rt__but there's - there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions or at least that you can start to answer .__c2
__s^cs__yep .__c8
__s__it seems like you could hold some meetings .__c1
__s^ba__so ==__c2
__b__you know - you and maybe adam .__c1
__s.%-__you - you could - you could maybe hold some additional meetings if you wanted .__c1
__s^bk|s__would it help at all ?==__c0
__s^bd__i mean we're already talking about sort of two levels of detail in meetings .__c0
__b__one is uh - um - without doing the digits or i guess the full blown one is where you do the digits and everything and then talk about doing it without digits .__c0
__s.%--__what if we had another level just to collect data which is without the headsets and we just did the table mounted stuff ?__c0
__s__need the close talking mikes .__c2
__s.%-__you do okay .__c0
__s.%--__i mean - absolutely .__c2
__fg|s^ba__yeah yeah .__c4
__qw.%--__yeah i'm really scared ==__c2
__s^fe^t1__it seems like it's a big part of this corpus is to have the close talking mikes .__c8
__s.%--__um - | or at least like - me personally i would - i - couldn't use that data .__c2
__s__i see okay .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s^aa|s__i agree .__c1
__fh__um ==__c2
__s^fe^j__and mari also .__c1
__qw.%--__we had - this came up when she- - she was here .__c1
__s^bd__that's important .__c1
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__qh^t1__so it's a great idea .__c2
__fh__i - i - b- - by the - by the way i don't think the transcriptions are actually in the long run such a big bottleneck .__c4
__s.%--__and if it were true than i would just do that .__c2
__qy.%--__but it's not that bad .__c2
__qw__like the room is not the bottleneck .__c2
__qy__and we have enough time in the room .__c2
__s^e:qw__it's getting the people to come in and put on the - and get the setup going .__c2
__s:s__i think the issue is just that we're - we're blazing that path .__c4
__s__right ?__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__and - and um - | d- - do you have any idea when - when uh - the - you'll be able to send uh - the ten hours to them ?__c4
__s__well | i've been burning two c d's a day which is about all i can do with the time i have .__c8
__s.%-__yeah .__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__so it'll be early next week .__c8
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah okay .__c4
__b__so early next week we send it to them .__c4
__%-__and then - then we check with them to see if they've got it .__c4
__s.%--__and we - we start you know - asking about the timing for it .__c4
__s^bd^df__yep .__c8
__s^rt__so | i think once they get it sorted out about how they're going to do it which i think they're pretty well along on because they were able to read the files and so on .__c4
__s^bk__yep .__c8
__s.%--__right ?__c4
__s__yeah but ==__c8
__b__well ==__c4
__s^bk__yeah who knows where they are ?__c8
__s^cs__have they ever responded to you ?__c0
__s^aa__nope .__c8
__fh|s.%-__yeah but you know - so they - they - they have - you know - they're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do .__c4
__s^am^cs^no__what if ==__c2
__s.%-__yeah you - we can't complain .__c8
__b.%__right ?__c4
__s^cs.%-__but they - but at any rate they'll - i - i think once they get that sorted out they're - they're making cassettes there - then they're handing it to someone who they - who's - who is doing it .__c4
__s__and uh - | i think it's not going to be - i don't think it's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour .__c4
__qw__i think it's not going to be thirty ==__c4
__s^ar|s^nd__yep | i think that's probably true .__c8
__%-__really ?__c2
__s^2__so it's the amount of ==__c2
__s^cs^j__it's - it's just getting it going .__c4
__s^ba__it's pipeline - pipeline issues .__c8
__s^cs^j__right .__c2
__fh__what about these lunch meetings ?__c2
__s^df__once the pipeline fills ==__c8
__b^rt__i mean - i don't know if there's any way without too much more overhead even if we don't ship it right away to i b m - even if we just collect it here for awhile - to record you know - two or three more meeting a week .__c2
__s^e__just to have the data even if they're um - not doing the digits but they do wear the headphones .__c2
__s^e__but the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and ==__c4
__s^bd|s^ba__no i meant ==__c2
__fh__um | sorry - the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs .__c2
__s^co__maybe they don't want to be recorded but ==__c2
__fg|s.%--__oh and we're just chatting ?__c8
__fh__just the ch- - the chatting .__c2
__s__yeah we have a lot of those .__c8
__s^cc__i actually - i actually think that's useful data um - the chatting .__c2
__s^aa__yeah | the problem with that is i would - i think i would feel a little constrained to you know uh - some of the meetings .__c8
__s^na__but ==__c2
__s__okay .__c2
__s^ba__you don't want to do it because ==__c2
__s__okay .__c2
__s__you know - our soccer ball meeting ?__c8
__s^aa__i guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting .__c8
__s.%--__all right .__c2
__s^aa__all right so i'll just throw it out there .__c2
__s.%--__that was hilarious .__c8
__%-__if anyone knows of one more m- - or two more wee- - meetings per week that happen at icsi um - that we could record i think it would be worth it .__c2
__b__yeah | well we should also check with mari again because they - because they were really intending you know - maybe just didn't happen but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level .__c4
__b__so then that would double what we had .__c4
__fh|s__and - there's a lot of different meetings at u w .__c4
__s__uh - | i mean - really m- - a lot more than we have here right because we're not right on campus .__c4
__s__right .__c8
__b__so ==__c4
__s^df.%--__is the uh - notion of recording any of chuck's meetings dead in the water ?__c0
__b__or is that still a possibility ?__c0
__qy^d^f^g__uh - | they seem to have some problems with it we can - we can talk about that later .__c4
__s^df__um - | but again jerry is - jerry's open .__c4
__b__so i mean - we have two speech meetings one uh - network meeting .__c4
__s^bu__uh - jerry was open to it but i- - i s- ==__c4
__b__one of the things that i think is a little - a little bit of a limitation there is a think when the people are not involved uh - in our work we probably can't do it every week .__c4
__b__you know - i - i - i - i think that - that people are going to feel uh - are going to feel a little bit constrained .__c4
__s^aa__now it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time .__c4
__s^aa__yep .__c8
__qy^d^g__and the - then - so then they can just really sort of try to put the mikes on and then just charge in and ==__c4
__s__what if we give people you know - we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ?__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__well you know - i - i do think eating while you're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise .__c1
__qy__okay .__c2
__%-__all right all right all right .__c2
__s^aa|s^df.%--__but i had another question which is um - you know - in principle w- - um - i know that you don't want artificial topics .__c1
__b__but um - it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial .__c1
__fh__i mean - we could - political discussions or - or something or other .__c1
__s__no definitely .__c2
__b__and ==__c1
__s__i- - you know - people who are ==__c1
__b__because you know - there's also this constraint - we d- ==__c1
__s__it's like - you know - the - the - uh - goldibears - goldi - goldilocks .__c1
__s__it's like you don't want meetings that are too large but you don't want meetings that are too small .__c1
__s.%--__and um - a- - and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj- - human subject p- - p- - pool in the positive sense of the word .__c1
__s^df__well even i mean - coming down from campus is sort of a big thing but what about ==__c0
__s^e__we could pay subjects .__c1
__b__or what about people in the - in the building ?__c0
__b__yeah i was thinking there's all these other peo- ==__c2
__qy^d^f^g^rt__i mean - there's the state of california downstairs and ==__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__b__i mean ==__c2
__s^e__i just really doubt that uh - any of the state of california meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public .__c8
__s^bk|s^bu__yeah .__c1
__%-__oh .__c0
__s^am__uhhuh .__c2
__s.%--__so i - i mean - i talked with some people at the haas business school who are i- - who are interested in speech recognition .__c8
__s__all right well ==__c2
__s^bk|s__and they sort of hummed and hawed and said well maybe we could have meetings down here .__c8
__s^e__but then i got email from them that said no we decided we're not really interested and we don't want to come down and hold meetings .__c8
__%-__so i think it's going to be a problem to get people regularly .__c8
__s^am^cs__what about joachim maybe he can ?==__c0
__b__but - but we c- - but i think - you know - we get some scattered things from this and that .__c4
__s__and i - i d- - i do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the - with the radio .__c4
__s^df__uh - | i- - i have better contacts in radio than in television but ==__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__b__you could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones .__c0
__s__yep .__c8
__s^cs.%--__well and they're already - they're - these things are already recorded .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__s^cs^e__we don't have to ask them to ==__c2
__fg|s__even - and i'm not sure wh- - how they record it - but they must record from individual ==__c2
__qy^d^f^g__n- - well ==__c4
__%-__no i'm not talking about ones that are already recorded .__c4
__s^bk__i'm talking about new ones .__c4
