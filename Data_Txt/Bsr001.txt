__z__yeah i think i got my mike on .__c0
__z__okay .__c0
__z__let's see .__c0
__z__DIGIT_TASK__c0
__z__okay | ami do yours .__c1
__z__then we'll open it .__c1
__z__and i think it'll be enough .__c1
__z__huh - doesn't uh - it should be the other way .__c0
__z__yeah now it's on .__c0
__z__right okay .__c5
__z__DIGIT_TASK__c5
__z__okay .__c1
__z__so we all switched on ?__c1
__z__we are all switched on | yeah .__c0
__z__all right .__c1
__z__we are all switched on .__c5
__z__anyway so | uh before we get started with the uh technical part i just want to review what i think is happening with the our data collection .__c1
__z__so uh | probably after today that shouldn't come up in this meeting .__c1
__z__th- - this - this is s- - should be im- - it isn't - there's another thing going on of gathering data .__c1
__z__and that's pretty much independent of this .__c1
__z__but uh i just want to make sure we're all together on this .__c1
__z__what we think is going to happen is that uh in parallel starting about now we're going to get fey to where you're working with me and robert draft a note that we're going to send out to various cogsci c- - and other classes saying here's an opportunity to be a subject .__c1
__z__contact fey .__c1
__z__and then there'll be a certain number of um hours during the week which she will be available .__c1
__z__and we'll bring in people .__c1
__z__uh roughly how many robert ?__c1
__z__we d- - do we know ?__c1
__z__um fifty was our - sort of our first ==__c2
__z__okay | so we're looking for a total of fifty people .__c1
__z__not necessarily by any means all students .__c1
__z__but we'll s- - we'll start with - with that .__c1
__z__in parallel with that we're going to need to actually do the script .__c1
__z__and so i guess there's a plan to have a meeting friday afternoon uh with - uh jane and maybe liz and whoever on actually getting the script worked out .__c1
__z__but what i'd like to do if it's okay is to s- - to as i say start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week .__c1
__z__the week after that's spring break .__c1
__z__and maybe we'll look for them - some subjects next door .__c1
__z__yeah .__c2
__z__or i- ==__c1
__z__yeah | also fey will not be here during spring break .__c2
__z__oh okay | then we won't do it .__c1
__z__so ==__c2
__z__okay .__c1
__z__so that's easy .__c1
__z__um ==__c1
__z__so is - is that make sense to everybody ?__c1
__z__yeah .__c2
__z__also um f- - both fey and i will um do something of which i may uh kindly ask you to - to do the same thing .__c2
__z__which is we going to check out our social infrastructures for possible subjects .__c2
__z__meaning um kid children's gymnastic classes .__c2
__z__preschool parents and so forth .__c2
__z__they also sometimes have flexible schedules .__c2
__z__so if you happen to be sort of in a non student social setting ==__c2
__z__and you know people who may be interested in being subjects ==__c2
__z__we also considered using the berkeley high school and their teachers maybe .__c2
__z__and get them interested in stuff .__c2
__z__that's a good idea .__c1
__z__and um ==__c2
__z__so that's as far as our brainstorming was concerned .__c2
__z__oh yeah | the high school's a great idea .__c1
__z__so ==__c2
__z__but i - i will just make a first draft of the uh note .__c2
__z__the write up note .__c2
__z__send it to you and fey .__c2
__z__and then ==__c2
__z__and why don't you also copy jane on it ?__c1
__z__and um ==__c2
__z__are we - have we concurred that uh these - these forms are sufficient for us and necessary ?__c2
__z__uh th- - i think they're necessary .__c1
__z__this - the permission form .__c1
__z__huh .__c2
__z__nuh .__c2
__z__uh there has to be one .__c1
__z__and i think we're just going to use it as it is .__c1
__z__and um ==__c1
__z__n.  .__c2
__z__you happy with that ?__c2
__z__well yeah .__c1
__z__there's one tricky part about ==__c1
__z__um ==__c1
__z__they have the right ==__c1
__z__um ==__c1
__z__i- - the last paragraph if you agree to participate you have the opportunity to have anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set .__c1
__z__okay .__c1
__z__now that we- - had to be included for this other one .__c1
__z__which might have uh meetings you know about something .__c1
__z__uhhuh .__c2
__z__in this case it doesn't really make sense .__c1
__z__um | so what i'd like to do is also have our subjects sign a waiver saying i don't want to see the final transcript .__c1
__z__uhhuh .__c2
__z__and if they don't - if they say no i'm not willing to sign that then we'll show them the final transcript .__c1
__z__but um ==__c1
__z__yep | makes sense .__c2
__z__that uh ==__c1
__z__yeah so we might actually ==__c1
__z__um ==__c1
__z__s- - i- - jane may say that you know you can't do this .__c1
__z__uh on the same form we need a separate form .__c1
__z__but anyway i'd - i'd - i'd like to e- - e- - um add an- - a little thi- - uh - a thing for them to initial saying nah do- - i don't want to see the final transcript .__c1
__z__uhhuh .__c2
__z__but other than that that's one's been approved .__c1
__z__this really is the same project .__c1
__z__uh rec- ==__c1
__z__you know ==__c1
__z__and so forth .__c1
__z__so i think we just go with it .__c1
__z__yeah .__c2
__z__yeah .__c2
__z__okay .__c2
__z__so much for the data .__c2
__z__except that with munich everything is fine now .__c2
__z__they're going to transcribe .__c2
__z__they're also going to translate the uh german data from the t. v and cinema stuff for andreas .__c2
__z__so ==__c2
__z__they're - they all seem to be happy now with that .__c2
__z__so ==__c2
__z__w- - c- - sh- - should we move on to the technical sides ?__c2
__z__yep .__c1
__z__well i guess the good - good news of last week was the parser .__c2
__z__so um ==__c2
__z__bhaskara and i started working on the - the parser .__c2
__z__then bhaskara went to class and once he came back um it was finished .__c2
__z__so ==__c2
__z__it uh - i didn't measure it .__c2
__z__but it was about an hour and ten minutes .__c2
__z__yep .__c3
__z__something like that .__c3
__z__and um - and now it's - we have a complete english parser that does everything the german parser does .__c2
__z__which is not a lot .__c1
__z__that's the uh point .__c3
__z__but ==__c1
__z__the - uh that's not a lot .__c2
__z__yes .__c3
__z__okay .__c1
__z__right .__c1
__z__and um ==__c2
__z__what did you end up having to do ?__c4
__z__i mean wha- - was there anything interesting about it at all ?__c4
__z__well if you uh ==__c2
__z__we'll show you .__c3
__z__yeah | we can show us .__c1
__z__or are we going to see that ?__c4
__z__right ?__c1
__z__well w- - w- - we d- - the first we did is we - we tried to - to do - change the - the laufen into run or running or runs .__c2
__z__yep .__c1
__z__uhhuh .__c4
__z__and we noticed that whatever we tried to do it no effect .__c2
__z__okay .__c4
__z__and we were puzzled .__c2
__z__uhhuh .__c4
__z__and uh the reason was that the parser i- - c- - completely ignores the verb .__c2
__z__huh .__c4
__z__so this sentence - sentence is parses the p- - the same output .__c2
__z__interesting parser property .__c4
__z__um even if you leave out um all - all of this .__c2
__z__i see .__c4
__z__yeah .__c4
__z__so it's basically feature film and t. v .__c2
__z__today .__c4
__z__that's what you need .__c2
__z__okay .__c4
__z__and the - t- - and the time | right ?__c4
__z__if - if you'd add - add today and evening it'll add time or not .__c2
__z__so it - i- - it does look at that .__c2
__z__okay .__c4
__z__but all the rest is p- - simply frosting on the cake .__c2
__s^ba__and it's optional for that parser .__c2
__s^ba__true .__c4
__s.%--__so you can sho- - you - you - are - are you going to show us the little templates ?__c1
__qw__and ==__c2
__h|s__s- ==__c4
__s^bk__yeah | we ar- - we can sh- - uh - i can show you the templates .__c2
__s^bk__the former end g- ==__c4
__s^ba__i - i also have it running here .__c2
__s.%-__oh i see .__c4
__s.%-__uhhuh .__c4
__s.%-__so if i do this now um you can see that it parsed the wonderful english sentence which films are on the cinema today evening .__c2
__b__but um ==__c2
__s^2__well that sounds ==__c1
__s__uh do- - don't worry about it .__c2
__%-__it could be this evening which - which films are on the cinema .__c2
__s__no | i- ==__c1
__s__or running in the cinema .__c2
__b__which ==__c2
__s^bk__okay .__c4
__qy^d__uh today evening uh i- - is anything happening in the cinema this evening .__c2
__b__okay | key words e- - basically .__c4
__s^na__well ==__c1
__s^aa__ge- - elaborate or more or less uh ==__c2
__s.%--__actually it's a little tricky in that there's some allowable german orders which aren't allowable english orders and so forth .__c1
__s__and it is order based .__c1
__s^ba__so it - it ==__c1
__s^ba__isn't it ?__c1
__s^bk__no .__c3
__qy^cs__no .__c2
__fg__oh | so it - it doe- - i- - it - these u- - these optional elements ==__c1
__%__it is not ==__c2
__s^bk__it's - it's actually a set ?__c1
__s.%--__not a sequence .__c1
__s__yeah | we were - i was afraid that um ==__c2
__%__oh .__c1
__%-__so it really is key word matching basically .__c4
__s__really a se- ==__c1
__s^co__e- - yeah .__c5
__s^j__um ==__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk__oh wow !__c1
__s__um i mean these sentences are just silly .__c2
__s^co__huh .__c4
__b__i mean uh d- - these were not the ones we - we actually did it .__c2
__fh|s^df__um ==__c2
__s__what's an idiomatic of phrasing this ?__c2
__s^bk__which films are showing .__c2
__s^ba__@@ are pl- - playing at the cinema .__c3
__%-__playing .__c2
__s^fe__yeah .__c3
__s__tonight .__c4
__b__i changed that file actually where it's on my account .__c3
__fh__this - this evening .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__actually you would say which films are on tonight .__c5
__s.%--__you want to get it ?__c3
__s^aa__or - is - di- - was it easy to get it ?__c3
__qrr__um | i have no net here .__c2
__s^bk__oh okay .__c3
__s^na__do i ?__c1
__s^bk__okay so | wonderful parse .__c2
__s^df^na__same thing .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__um ==__c2
__%-__right .__c1
__s^na__except that we d- - w- - we don't have this uh time information here now .__c2
__b__which is ==__c2
__s^bk__um ==__c2
__s__oh this - are the reserve .__c2
__s__anyways so ==__c2
__qw__um | these are the - sort of the ten different sentence types that the uh the parser was able to do .__c2
__s__and it still is now in english .__c2
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s__and um ==__c2
__s__sorry .__c2
__%__and um ==__c2
__fg__you have already to make it a little bit more elaborate | right ?__c2
__%-__yeah | i mean i changed those sentences to make it uh more uh idiomatic .__c3
__s^aa__and of course you can have i- - many variations in those sentences they will still parse fine .__c3
__fg__so in a sense it's pretty broad .__c3
__s^aa__okay .__c1
__s^aa__okay .__c2
__s__so if you want to look at the templates they're conveniently located in a file template .__c2
__s__um ==__c2
__%-__and this is what i had to do .__c2
__b__i had to change @@ spielfilm to film .__c2
__s__uh film to movie .__c2
__s^bk__cinem- - kino to cinema .__c2
__s^ba__to- - today - heu- - heute to today .__c2
__%-__huh .__c4
__s__evening - abend to evening .__c2
__qy^g__capitalized as well .__c1
__qy^rt__huh .__c0
__s.%-__and um ==__c2
__s^ng.%-__one thing i was wondering was those functions there are those things that modify the m. three l. basically ?__c3
__s.%-__y- - i- ==__c1
__%__yep .__c2
__s^aa|s__okay .__c3
__s__and that's - that's the next step .__c2
__b__but we'll get to that in a second .__c2
__b__p- ==__c1
__%__and so this means um ==__c2
__s^aa__oh .__c1
__s^cs__this and see are not optional .__c2
__s.%-__want i like is all maybe in there .__c2
__s^cs__but may also not be in there .__c2
__s__so - so the point is if it says this and see it also will work in see and this .__c1
__b__s- ==__c4
__s.%-__in the other order .__c1
__s^fe__yeah .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__with those two key words .__c1
__s^aa__should we try it ?__c2
__s__this is the one i want to see .__c1
__b__or whatever .__c1
__b__okay .__c2
__s.%-__action watch .__c2
__qy^d^rt__huh .__c3
__b__whatever .__c2
__s__nothing was specialfi- - specified .__c2
__b__except that it has some references to audio visual media here .__c2
__b__a. v medium .__c3
__s^ba__yeah .__c3
__fg__where it gets that from ==__c2
__s__it's correct .__c2
__s__but i don't know where it gets it from .__c2
__s^aa__see .__c3
__s^co__oh | see .__c2
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__s^aa^r__i mean it's sort of ==__c3
__s^ng__yeah yep okay .__c2
__fh__and see this is exactly the same thing .__c2
__b__okay | so it is set based .__c1
__fg__all right .__c1
__s__one thing i was wondering was those percentage signs | right .__c3
__s^df__so i mean why do we even have them ?__c3
__s__because - if you didn't have them ==__c3
__s^aa__yep .__c2
__b__uh i'll tell you why .__c2
__s^aa^r__because it gives a - you a score .__c2
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c4
__fg__oh .__c3
__s^bk|s^cs__and the value of the score is v- - i assume i guess the more of these optional things that are actually in there the higher the r- - score it is .__c2
__s^aa__okay .__c3
__s^df__right .__c5
__s^bk__it's a match .__c4
__s__so that's the main purpose | all right .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__fg|s__okay .__c1
__%-__so we - we shouldn't belittle it too much .__c2
__s^ba__it's doing something .__c2
__s^t3__some things .__c2
__s^e__and it's very flexible .__c2
__s^df__i've just tried to ==__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s^ar.%__right .__c5
__s^fa^t3__be nice .__c2
__b__no no .__c1
__qw^t3__right - yeah .__c4
__b__fine .__c1
__qw^t3__yeah yeah yeah | flexible it is .__c1
__b__but ==__c5
__s^bk|s__okay | um let's hope that the generation will not be more difficult .__c2
__qy^t3__even though the generator is a little bit more complex .__c2
__fh__uh but we'll ==__c2
__s^r__huh ==__c2
__%__that means we may need two hours and twenty minutes rather than an hour ten minutes .__c2
__fh|s__right .__c3
__s^ar^t3|s^t3__i hope .__c2
__s^ar^r^t3__all right .__c1
__s^ba__and the next thing i would like to be able to do and it seems like this would not be too difficult either is to say okay let's now pretend we actually wanted to not only change the - the mapping of - of uh words to the m. three l. but we also wanted to change - add a new sentence type .__c2
__s^ar^t3__and and make up some - some new m. three l. - s- ==__c2
__b__yep .__c1
__s^t3__so- ==__c1
__s.%-__that'd be great .__c1
__qy^rt__it would be a good exercise to just see whether one can get that to run .__c1
__s^bk^t3__see th- ==__c2
__s^t3.%--__uhhuh yep .__c2
__s^na__and um ==__c2
__b__so that's ==__c3
__s^co__fine yeah .__c3
__s^df__that's - shouldn't be too tough .__c2
__s^t3__yeah | so where are those ?==__c3
__b__those functions action goodbye and so on | right .__c3
__s^t3__are they actually um are they going to be called ?__c3
__s^t3__um are they present in the code for the parser ?__c3
__s__yeah | i think what it does it i- - i- - it does something sort of fancy .__c2
__s^aa__it loads ==__c2
__%__um ==__c2
__z__it has these style sheets and also the um schemata .__c2
__s^2__so what it probably does is it takes the ==__c2
__qy^g^t3__uh um ==__c2
__s^nd__is this where it is ?__c2
__z__this is already the x. m. l stuff .__c2
__s__this is where it takes its own um syntax .__c2
__s^ba__and converts it somehow .__c2
__b__um ==__c2
__s.%-__where is the uh ?==__c2
__fh__what are you looking for ?__c3
__z__um where it actually produces the - the x. m. l out of the uh parsed stuff .__c2
__s__oh okay .__c3
__s^t3__no this is not it .__c2
__b__uh i can't find it now .__c2
__s^no^t3__you mean where the - where the act- - how the action goodbye maps into something ==__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__b__yeah | where are those constructors defined ?__c0
__s.%--__oh .__c3
__qy^d^f^g^t3__nope .__c2
__b__no | that's not it .__c3
__z__yeah .__c2
__fh|s^rt__this is sort of what happens .__c2
__s^ba^fe^t3__this is what you would need to - to change - to get the uh x. m. l changed .__c2
__z__so when it encounts- - encounters day it will uh ==__c2
__s^no__activate those h- - classes in the - in the x. m. l stuff .__c2
__z__but um ==__c2
__s__i saw those actions - uh the goodbye stuff somewhere .__c2
__s__huh huh huh huh huh .__c2
__s__grep for it ?__c0
__s^aa__yeah | let's do that .__c2
__s__oh .__c2
__z__huh .__c3
__s^aa__m. three l. dot d. t. d .__c3
__z__yep .__c2
__s__that's just a specification for the x. m. l format .__c3
__s^ba__yep .__c2
__s^ba^fe^t3__well we'll find that out .__c2
__s^df__so whatever - n- - this does ==__c2
__qy^rt^t3__i mean this is basically looks l- - to me like a function call | right ?__c2
__fh__huh ?__c1
__z__oh yeah .__c1
__fh__and um ==__c2
__s^ar^t3__so whenever it - it encounters goodbye ==__c2
__s^nd^t3__which we can make it do in a second here .__c2
__s^bk^t3__that function automatically generates an initialized x. m. l structure .__c0
__s^bk^r^t3__i think each of those functions act on the current x. m. l structure and change it in some way for example by adding a - a l- - a field to it or something .__c3
__fh__i- ==__c2
__s^t3__y- ==__c1
__s^t3__yeah | they also seem to affect state .__c1
__s.%-__uhhuh .__c2
__s^bk^t3__cause some of them ==__c1
__s^t3.%--__there were other actions uh that - that s- - seemed to step - state variables somewhere .__c1
__s^ba^t3__right .__c3
__s^ba^t3__like the n- - s- - discourse status confirm .__c1
__b__yep .__c2
__b__okay so that's going to be a call on the discourse .__c1
__s__and confirm that it's ==__c1
__b__w- - we- - uhhuh ==__c2
__s^ba__oh | you mean that's not going to actually modify the tree .__c3
__b__but it's going to change the event .__c3
__b__i think that's right .__c1
__s^na__e- ==__c2
__s^aa__i think it's actually - that looks like it's state modification .__c1
__s.%-__oh oh .__c3
__fg__e- - huh ==__c2
__s^bk__um well i- ==__c2
__s__there is a feature called discourse status .__c2
__fg__when there's a feature .__c3
__qw^rt__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__and so whenever i just say write it will - it will put this in here .__c2
__s^aa__oh | so it always just ==__c1
__%-__is it - so it ?==__c1
__s.%-__well go back then .__c1
__qw.%-__h- ==__c2
__s__because it may be that all those th- - things while they look like function calls are just a way of adding exactly that to the x. m. l .__c1
__s^ba__yep .__c2
__s^ba__uhhuh .__c1
__qy.%-__i'm not - i'm not sure .__c1
__s^aa__so this ==__c2
__s^cs__e- - i'm not sure - e- - that ==__c1
__s.%-__um - well we - we'll see when we say ==__c2
__s__let's test something .__c2
__%-__goodbye causes it to c- - to create basically an action goodbye end action .__c2
__fg|s__which is a means of telling the system to shut down .__c2
__s^aa__right .__c1
__b__right .__c1
__s.%-__now if we know that write produces a feature discourse status confirm discourse status .__c2
__s^aa__so if i now say write goodbye it should do that .__c2
__b__it sho- - it creates this .__c2
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c3
__b__right .__c1
__s^df__confirm goodbye .__c2
__b__right there .__c3
__fg__yep .__c1
__s.%-__but there is some kind of function call .__c3
__s^aa__because how does it know to put goodbye in content but uh confirm in features ?__c3
__s^df__so- ==__c3
__s^aa__oh .__c2
__s^df__it d- - it - n- - that's because ==__c2
__b__so it's not just that it's adding that field .__c3
__s^df__it's ==__c3
__b__right .__c1
__b__absolutely .__c1
__s^df__okay .__c3
__fg__good point .__c1
__s^aa__it's - it's - the - it's under what subtype you're doing it .__c1
__s^ar__uhhuh .__c2
__s^df__yeah .__c1
__s^co^fe__yeah .__c2
__b__it's mystery functions .__c0
__s^df__well they're defined somewhere presumably .__c3
__b__well sometimes it m- - sometimes i- ==__c2
__fh__yeah | each is ==__c1
__s^aa__when it ==__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__s- - so that's funny .__c1
__%-__you bury the s- - the state in the function .__c1
__h|s__all right .__c1
__s__uh @@ ==__c1
__s__well it just automatically initializes things that are common | right ?__c0
__b__it ==__c2
__b__so it's just a shorthand .__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__for example ==__c2
__s^bk|s__oh this is german .__c2
__s^df__sorry .__c2
__fh__e- ==__c2
__b__so now this it cannot do anymore .__c2
__s^aa__nothing comes out of here .__c2
__b__a not a number is a value | awesome .__c0
__b__so it doesn't speak german anymore .__c2
__s__but it does speak english .__c2
__s__and there is here a reference .__c2
__s^df__so this tells us that whatever is - has the i. d zero is referenced here by @@ the restriction seed .__c2
__b__and this is exa- - i want ==__c2
__s.%-__what was the sentence ?__c2
__s__i want two seats here .__c1
__fh__need two seats here | nuh .__c2
__s__and where is it playing there should also be a reference to something maybe .__c2
__s__our d- - this is re- - um ==__c2
__b__huh .__c2
__s^bk|%-__here we change - and so we - here we add something to the discourse status that the user wants to change something that was sort of done before .__c2
__s^bk|s^na__and uh ==__c2
__s^aa__and that whatever is being changed has something to do with the cinema .__c2
__b__so then whatever takes this m. three l. is what actually changes the state .__c0
__s__not the ==__c0
__s^ba__yeah okay .__c0
__b__no right | the discourse maintainer .__c1
__b__yeah .__c0
__s^ba__yeah .__c1
__%-__i see .__c1
__%-__and it - and it runs around looking for discourse status tags .__c1
__s^aa__and doing whatever it does with them .__c1
__s^na__and other people ignore those tags .__c1
__s^aa__all right .__c1
__s^ba^na__so yeah | i definitely think it's it's worth the exercise of trying to actually add something that isn't there .__c1
__fh__huh .__c2
__qy^cs.%-__uh ==__c1
__%__disc- ==__c1
__s^nd__sort of get a complete understanding of the whole thing .__c2
__s^aa__yeah | a kid understanding what's going on .__c1
__s__then the next thing we talked about is actually um figuring out how to add our own tags and stuff like that .__c1
__s^am__okay .__c2
__fg|%-__point number two .__c2
__s.%__i got the uh m. three l. for the routes today .__c2
__%-__uh so i got some more .__c2
__%-__this is sort of the ==__c2
__s^j__uh um ==__c2
__%-__huh .__c2
__%__interesting .__c2
__s__it's just going up .__c2
__s^j__it's not going back down .__c2
__s__so this is - um what i got today is the - the new um m. three l. for um the maps .__c2
__%-__yep .__c1
__s^j__uh and with some examples .__c2
__b__so this is the x. m. l and this is sort of what it will look like later on .__c2
__b__even though it - you can't see it on - on this resolution .__c2
__s^ar^j|s^df^j^nd__and this is what it - sort of is the - the structure of map requests .__c2
__s^j__um ==__c2
__s^fa__also not very interesting .__c2
__qo^rt__and here is the more interesting stuff for us is the routes .__c2
__fh__route elements .__c2
__qy.%--__and again as we thought it's really simple .__c2
__fg__this is sort of the uh um parameters .__c2
__s__we have @@ simple from objects and to objects and so forth .__c2
__s__points of interest along the way .__c2
__s__and um ==__c2
__s__i asked them whether or not we could um ==__c2
__b__first of all i was little bit ==__c2
__fh__it seemed to me that this m- - way of doing it is sort of a stack- - a step backwards from the way we've done it before .__c2
__s^bk__t- ==__c2
__s__it seems to me that some notions were missing .__c2
__qy^rt__so these are - these are ==__c2
__%-__s- ==__c1
__s^df__so these are - these are your friends back at e. m. l .__c1
__qy__yep .__c2
__b__who are doing this .__c2
__qrr.%--__so this is not a complicated negotiation .__c1
__s^na__no .__c2
__s__there's - there's not seven committees or anything | right ?__c1
__b__no | this is very straightforward .__c2
__b__great .__c1
__s__so this is just trying to ==__c1
__s__it's a design thing not a political thing .__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^df__once we've - uh - we can just sort of agree on what ought to be done .__c1
__b__exactly .__c2
__b__good .__c1
__s^df__and um ==__c2
__%-__and uh ==__c2
__s__however the uh e- - so that you understand it is really simple .__c2
__s__uh - you - you have a route .__c2
__s.%-__and you cut it up in different pieces .__c2
__s.%-__and every - every element of that e- - r- - r- - f- - of that every segment we call a route element .__c2
__s__and so from a.  to b.  we cut up in three different steps .__c2
__s^bk__and every step has a from object where you start a to object .__c2
__s^nd__where y- - where you sort of end and some points of interest along the way .__c2
__%-__what w- - i was sort of missing here and uh maybe it was just me being too stupid is i didn't sort of get the - the notion of the global goal of the whole route .__c2
__s^df__really s- - was not straightforward visibly for me .__c2
__b__and some other stuff .__c2
__s^df__and i suggested that they should n- - be - k- - uh kind enough to do s- - two things for us .__c2
__s^bk__is one um also allocating uh some tags for our action schema enter vista approach .__c2
__fh__and ==__c2
__s__and also um | since you had suggested that that um we figure out if we ever for a demo reason wanted to shortcut directly to the g- - g. i. s and the planner ==__c2
__b__of how we can do it .__c2
__qy^bh__now what's the state of the art of getting to entrances .__c2
__qy^d__um what's the syntax for that ?__c2
__s^e__how get- - getting to vista points and calculating those on the spot ?__c2
__s^bk|%-__and the approach mode anyhow is the default .__c2
__qrr.%--__that's all they do it these days .__c2
__s^aa__wherever you'll find a route planner it n- - does nothing but get to the closest point where the street network is at minimal distance to the geometric center .__c2
__qy^bh__uhhuh .__c1
__s__@@ .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__so ==__c2
__b__so | well let - now this is important .__c1
__s^aa__let uh - i want a- - a- - again outside of m- - almost managerial point ==__c1
__s^df__um ==__c1
__s^ba^fe__you're in the midst of this .__c1
__s^df__so you know better .__c1
__s^ba__but it seems to me it's probably a good idea to li- - uh - minimize the number of uh change requests we make of them .__c1
__%__so it seemed to me what we ought to do is get our story together .__c1
__fh__okay ?__c1
__fh__and think about it some internally before asking them to make changes .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c2
__%__oh ==__c1
__s^aa__does this - does this make sense to you guys ?__c1
__s__it - i mean you're - you're doing the - the interaction .__c1
__b__but it seemed to me that what we ought to do is come up with a uh something where you um ==__c1
__s^aa__and i - i don't know who's mok- - working most closely on it .__c1
__b__probably johno .__c1
__s^aa__okay .__c1
__s^aa__uh take what they have .__c1
__s__send it to everybody saying this is what they have .__c1
__s^e__this is what we think we should add .__c1
__s__okay ?__c1
__fh__and then have a d- - a - an iteration within our group saying huh well ==__c1
__s__okay ?__c1
__b__and get our best idea of what we should add .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c2
__s^ba__and then go back to them .__c1
__fg__is i- ==__c1
__fg__or i don't know .__c1
__qw^rt__does this make sense to you ?__c1
__fh__or ?==__c1
__s^bk__yeah | especially if we want ==__c2
__qw__sort of what i - my feeling was uh- - we - we sort of reserved something that has a r- - uh- - an okay label .__c2
__s__that's - th- - that was my th- - first sort of step .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__b__i- - w- ==__c2
__s__no matter how we want to call it this is sort of our playground .__c2
__s__and if we get something in there that is a structure elaborate and - and - and - and - and complex enough to - to - to maybe enable a whole simulation one of these days that would be - u- - the - the perfect goal .__c2
__s^df__right .__c1
__b__right .__c1
__s^e__that's right .__c1
__s^e__so ==__c1
__b__so yeah .__c1
__s__the problem isn't the short ra- - range optimization .__c1
__b__it's the sort of - o- - one or two year kind of thing .__c1
__b__okay | what are the thl- - class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ?__c1
__s^e__how - how would we try to characterize those ?__c1
__s__and what do we want to request now that's leave enough space to do all that stuff ?__c1
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c2
__fh__yep .__c2
__fh|s__right .__c1
__s^e^rt__and that re- - that requires some thought .__c1
__b__yep .__c2
__fh__and - so that sounds like a great thing to do as the priority item .__c1
__s^e__um as soon as we can do it .__c1
__s^2__yep .__c2
__b__so y- - so you guys will send to the rest of us um a version of um this .__c1
__s__and - the - uh description .__c1
__b__with sugge- - yeah suggested improvements .__c0
__s^e__and ==__c0
__fh|s^e__well b- ==__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__fh__so the - the - uh - not everyone uh reads german .__c1
__s^df__so if you'd ==__c1
__s^t3__um ==__c1
__s^aa__huh .__c0
__fg__tu- - uh tur- - change the description to uh english .__c1
__fg__okay .__c0
__s.%-__and um ==__c1
__s__then - then ==__c1
__s^ba__yeah | then with some sug- - s- - suggestions about where - where do we go from here ?__c1
__s^aa__uh this - and this of course was just the action end .__c1
__s.%--__okay .__c0
__b__uh at some point we're going to have to worry about the language end .__c1
__s__but for the moment just uh t- - for this class of - of things we might want to try to encompass .__c1
__b__and ==__c1
__b__then the scope of this is beyond approach and vis- - or vista .__c0
__b__oh yeah yeah yeah yeah .__c1
__b__yeah yeah .__c0
__s^e__this is - this is everything that - that um you know um we might want to do in the next couple years .__c1
__b__yeah yeah .__c0
__b__so what would ==__c0
__fh__huh .__c2
__b__okay .__c0
__fg|s^cs__we don't - i mean that's an issue .__c1
__s^e__we don't know what entirely .__c1
__s.%-__uh yeah .__c0
__s^bk|%--__but i'm just ==__c0
__fg|s.%--__but the ==__c0
__b__yeah okay .__c0
__b__so i just ==__c0
__s__this x. m. l stuff here just has to do with source path goal type stuff .__c0
__b__in terms of traveling through heidelberg .__c0
__s^bk__huh .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__right .__c1
__s^df__or travel specifically .__c0
__b__so but this o- - is the domain greater than that ?__c0
__b__no .__c1
__s^ng__i think - i think the i- - the idea is that ==__c1
__s^df__okay .__c0
__b__oh | it's beyond source path goal .__c1
__b__but i think we don't need to get beyond it @@ tourists in heidelberg .__c1
__s:s^co__okay .__c0
__s^df__it seems to me we can get all the complexity we want in actions and in language without going outside of tourists in heidelberg .__c1
__b__okay ?__c1
__b__but you know i- - depending on what people are interested in one could have uh tours .__c1
__h|s__one could have um explanations of why something is - is you know why - why was this done .__c1
__s.%--__or ==__c1
__b__i mean no - there's no end .__c1
__s__to the complexity you can build into the uh what a tourist in heidelberg might ask .__c1
__s__huh .__c0
__s__so at least - unless somebody else wants t- - to suggest otherwise i think the general domain we don't have t- - to uh broaden .__c1
__b__that is tourists in heidelberg .__c1
__s^aa__and if there's something somebody comes up with that can't be done that way then sure .__c1
__fh|s^df__w- - we'll - we'll look at that .__c1
__b__but uh ==__c1
__b__i'd be s- - i- - i'd be surprised at ==__c1
__s^df__if there's any important issue that - that ==__c1
__b__and um ==__c1
__s__i mean if - if you want to uh push us into reference problems that would be great .__c1
__b__okay .__c5
__s__okay so this is - his specialty is - reference .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__fh__and - you know what - what are these things referring to ?__c1
__b__not only anaphora .__c1
__s__but uh more generally the uh this whole issue of uh referring expressions .__c1
__s^df__and what is it that they're actually dealing with in the world ?__c1
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c2
__s__and again this is li- - in the databa- - this is also pretty well formed .__c1
__fh__because there is an ontology .__c1
__s__and the database and stuff .__c1
__fg__so it isn't like um you know the evening star or stuff like that .__c1
__s^df__right .__c5
__b__i- - i- - it ==__c1
__s^df__all the entities do have concrete reference .__c1
__fg__right .__c5
__b__although th- - the to get at them from a language may not be trivial .__c1
__b__right .__c5
__s^bk__there aren't really deep mysteries about um what w- - what things the system knows about .__c1
__s__right .__c5
__b__and you have both proper names and descriptions .__c5
__b__and y- - and you can ask for it .__c5
__s__all those things .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c2
__s^bu__you have proper names and descriptions .__c1
__s^aa__right .__c5
__s^bu^e__okay .__c5
__s^aa__and a l- - and a lot - and - and anaphora and pronouns .__c1
__s^bk__nuh .__c2
__s__right .__c5
__s__and all those things .__c1
__s^aa__right .__c5
__fg__now we hav- - the - the whole - unfortunately the whole database is uh in german .__c2
__s.%--__we have just commissioned someone to translate some bits of it .__c2
__s__i. e the e- - the shortest k- - the - the more general descriptions of all the objects and um persons and events .__c2
__b__so it's a relational database with persons events and um objects .__c2
__s__and it's - it's quite um there .__c2
__b__but did y- - i - uh - i think there will be great .__c2
__s__because the reference problem really is not trivial even if you have such a g- - well defined world .__c2
__s^bk__he knows .__c1
__b__uh- - he- - you are not uh throwing uh uh carrying owls to athens .__c2
__b__could you give me an example of a reference problem ?__c0
__s__so - so l- - i can make it more concrete .__c0
__fg|%-__well how do i get to the powder tower .__c2
__b__we sort of t- - think that our bit in this problem is interesting .__c2
__b__but just to get from powder tower to an object i- - i. d in a database is also not really trivial .__c2
__s__or - or if you take something even more scary um how do i get to the third building after the tower .__c5
__s^bk__the ple- - powder tower .__c5
__s__huh .__c0
__s__uh you need some mechanism for ==__c5
__s^aa__yeah .__c1
__s^na__or you know the church across from city hall .__c1
__s.%-__or ==__c1
__b__or the re- - the restaurant where they wear lederhosen .__c0
__s__or the- ==__c2
__s^bk__right .__c5
__s^bk__or is that ?==__c0
__b__yeah | that would be fine .__c1
__s__right .__c5
__b__okay .__c0
__s^bu__yeah .__c1
__s^bk|s__right .__c5
__qy^g__o- - or - or tower or this tower or that building or ==__c2
__s^aa__uniquely .__c4
__b__huh .__c2
__s^aa__okay .__c0
__s^fa|s__or you can say how - you know how do i get back .__c1
__%__trying to ==__c0
__s.%--__yeah yeah .__c0
__s__okay .__c1
__s^bd__and again it's just a question of which of these things uh people want to dive into .__c1
__b__what uh i think i'm going to try to do ==__c1
__s__and i guess pwww .__c1
__s__let's say that by the end of spring break i'll try to come up with some general story about um construction grammar .__c1
__b__and what constructions we'd use .__c1
__s__and how all this might fit together .__c1
__s^df__there's this whole framework problem that i'm feeling really uncomfortable about .__c1
__fh__and i haven't had a chance to think about it seriously .__c1
__fh__but i - i want to - i want to do that early rather than late .__c1
__s__and you and i will probably have to talk about this some .__c1
__fh|s^df__u- - u- - u- - u- ==__c2
__b__that's what strikes me that we sort of .__c2
__b__the de- - g- - uh small ==__c2
__s__something uh maybe we should address one of these days is to - that most of the work people actually always do is look at some statements .__c2
__b__and - and analyze those .__c2
__s__whether it's abstracts or newspapers and stuff like this .__c2
__s__huh .__c1
__fg__but the whole - i- - is it - is it really relevant that we are dealing mostly with sort of questions ?__c2
__b__uh you know ==__c2
__s__oh yeah .__c1
__b__well i mean ==__c1
__b__yeah | i- - d- ==__c1
__b__and this is - it seems to me that we should maybe at least spend a session or - or brainstorm a little bit about whether that l- - this is special case in that sense .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__um ==__c2
__b__i don't know .__c2
__b__you know - did we ever find m- - metaphorical use in - in questions in - in that sense really ?__c2
__b__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__@@ .__c3
__fh__you will .__c1
__s__and how soon ?__c2
__b__i don't know .__c2
__b__oh yeah .__c1
__b__i mean uh we could take all the standard metaphor examples and make question versions of them .__c1
__b__okay .__c1
__fh__who got kicked out of france .__c2
__s__muh- ==__c5
__s^cs__nuh .__c2
__s^bk|s^ba.%-__yeah | or you know wh- - why is he - why is he pushing for promotion .__c1
__s__right .__c5
__b__or who's pushing proof- ==__c1
__s^ba^r__nuh .__c2
__b__uh just pick - pick any of them .__c1
__b__and just do the - uh ==__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__uhhuh .__c2
__b__so i don't - i don't think uh it's at all difficult uh to convert them to question forms that really exist and people say all the time .__c1
__b__um ==__c1
__s^df__and - sort of - we don't know how to handle them too .__c1
__s^2__right ?__c1
__b__i mean it's ==__c1
__b__i d- - it ==__c1
__s^df__we don't know how to handle the declarative forms @@ really .__c1
__b__and then the interrogative forms uhoh .__c1
__b__uh ==__c1
__s^df__ooo .__c3
__b__yeah .__c1
__s^df__nancy it looked like you were s- ==__c1
__fh__oh | it's just that - that the goals are g- - very different to cases .__c4
__s^bk|s__so we had this problem last year when we first thought about this domain actually .__c4
__s^aa__was that most of the things we talked about are our story understanding .__c4
__b__uh we're going to have a short discourse .__c4
__fh__right .__c1
__b__and the person talking is trying to i don't know give you a statement and tell you something .__c4
__s^aa^r__and here it's th- ==__c4
__s^e__help you create a mental model blah blah blah .__c2
__b__yeah .__c2
__%__yea- - uh - y- - yeah | i guess so .__c4
__qy^bh^rt__yes .__c1
__qy^d^rt__and then here y- - you are j- - uh the person is getting information .__c4
__s^e__and they or may not be following some larger plan you know that we have to recognize or you know infer .__c4
__b__and th- - th- - the - their discourse patterns probably don't follo- - follow quite as many logical connec- ==__c4
__s^aa__right | no i think that's one of things that's interesting .__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^ba__is - is in this sort of over-arching story we - we worked it out for th- - as you say this - the storytelling scenario .__c1
__qw.%--__uhhuh .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s^rt__and i think it's really worth thinking through what it looks like .__c1
__fh__uhhuh .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__what is the simspec mean et cetera ?__c1
__%--__m- ==__c4
__s^aa|s^na__right | because for a while we were thinking well how can we change the um data to sort of illicit tha- - illicit um actions that are more like what we are used to .__c4
__qw__but obviously we would rather you know try to figure out what's - what's you know ==__c4
__qw__well i don't know .__c1
__qw.%-__i mean maybe - maybe that's what we'll do is - is s- - u- - e- ==__c1
__s__we can do anything we want with it .__c1
__s^bk__yep .__c4
__s.%--__i mean once we have fulfilled these requirements ==__c1
__%--__huh - uhhuh .__c4
__%--__uhhuh .__c4
__%--__okay | and the one for next uh summer is just half done .__c1
__s^df__and then the other half is this um generation thing which we think isn't much different .__c1
__s^df__uhhuh .__c4
__s^no__so once that's done then all the rest of it is uh sort of you know what we want to do for the research .__c1
__s^df__and we can - w- - we can do all sorts of things that don't fit into their framework at all .__c1
__s^bk__th- - there's no reason why we're c- - we're constrained to do that .__c1
__fh|s^no__uhhuh .__c4
__fh__if we can use all the uh execution engines then we can you know really try things that would be too - too much pain to do ourselves .__c1
__s^df.%--__uhhuh .__c4
__s^am__but there's no obligation on any of this .__c1
__s^bk__so if we want to turn it into u- - understan- - standing stories about heidelberg we can do that .__c1
__s^aa__i mean that would just be a t- - a- - um ==__c1
__s__or as a matter of fact we need and if we if we'r- - uh - take a ten year perspective we need to do that .__c2
__s^aa__because ==__c2
__b__w- ==__c2
__b__e- - w- - a- - assuming we have this um we- - we- - ta- - in that case we actually do have these wonderful stories and historical anecdotes .__c2
__fh|s^tc__yeah .__c1
__b__and knights jumping out of windows .__c2
__s__huh .__c4
__s__and and and tons of stuff .__c2
__b__so th- - the database is huge .__c2
__fh__and if we want to answer a question on that we actually have to go one step before that and understand that .__c2
__fg__uhhuh .__c4
__s.%--__in order to e- - do sensible information extraction .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__fh|s__uhhuh .__c4
__b__and so ==__c2
__b__you might | yeah .__c1
__s^df__mwa- ==__c5
__b__um this has been a - a - a deep map research issue that was - is - is part of the unresolved and to-do's and something for the future is how can we sort of run our our text our content through a machine that will enable us later to retrieve or answer e- - questions more sensibly ?__c2
__fh__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk|s__uhhuh .__c4
__%--__huh .__c4
__s^aa|s^na__right .__c1
__s^df__anyway .__c1
__s^bk__s- ==__c1
__fh__who's going ?__c1
__s^bk^r__so uh - so uh | i was just going to ask .__c5
__fg|s__um so ==__c5
__fh__what is the - the basic thing that - that you are um obligated to do um uh by the summer before w- - uh y- - c- - we can move ?==__c5
__s^df__uh .__c1
__fh__okay .__c1
__s__so - uh - yeah ==__c1
__b__so what happened is ==__c1
__fh|s__there's this uh uh ==__c1
__b__robert was describing ==__c1
__s^df__the - there's two packages .__c1
__s^df__there's a uh quote parser .__c1
__s^e__there's a particular piece of this big system .__c1
__s^aa__which in german uh takes these t- - sentence templates and produces x. m. l structures .__c1
__s__right .__c5
__b__and one of our jobs was to make the english equivalent of that .__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__that these guys did in a - in a day .__c1
__s^aa__right .__c5
__b__right .__c5
__s^df__the other thing is at the other end roughly at the same level there's something that takes uh x. m. l structures produces an output x. m. l structure .__c1
__s^aa__which is instructions for the generator .__c1
__s^na__right .__c5
__b__okay .__c1
__s.%--__and then there's a language generator .__c1
__s__and then after that a s- - a synthesizer that goes from an x. m. l structure to uh language generation to actual specifications for a synthesizer .__c1
__s^aa__uh but again there's one module in which there's one piece that we have to convert to english .__c1
__s__right .__c5
__s__right .__c5
__fh__got it .__c5
__s__is that ?==__c1
__s^aa__okay .__c1
__s__and that - but as i say this is all along was viewed as a kind of a m- - a minor thing .__c1
__b__necessary but - but not ==__c1
__s__right .__c5
__s^2__okay ?__c1
__s^bk__right .__c5
__b__and much more interesting is the fact that as part of doing this we - we are you know inheriting this system that does all sort- - of these other things .__c1
__s__that's great .__c5
__s^df__right .__c5
__fg__not precisely what we want .__c1
__s^df__and that's - that's wh- - where it - it gets difficult .__c1
__s__and i - i don't pretend to understand yet what i think we really ought to do .__c1
__b__okay .__c2
__s^aa__so | e- - enough of that .__c2
__s__but i uh um ==__c2
__s^am__huh .__c2
__s.%-__the e- - sort of johno and i will take up that responsibility .__c2
__s^bk__and um get a first draft of that .__c2
__s__now we have um just i think two more short things .__c2
__b__okay .__c1
__s^df__um | y- - you guys sort of started fighting uh on the bayes-net noisy or front ?__c2
__b__huh .__c3
__fg__yeah | i thought i should um talk a little bit about that .__c3
__fg__because that might be a good uh sort of architecture to have in general for uh problems with you know multiple inputs to a node .__c3
__b__good | okay .__c1
__s__good .__c1
__s^ng__and what's the other one ?__c1
__s.%-__so that - just we know what the d- - agenda is .__c1
__s__um the wu paper .__c2
__qy^d.%--__i think maybe ==__c2
__b__oh yeah .__c1
__b__i've got a couple new wu papers as well .__c1
__s^nd__uh so i - i've been in contact with wu .__c1
__s^df^nd__so probably let's put that off till i - i - till i understand better uh what he's doing .__c1
__%--__it's just a little embarrassing .__c1
__s^nd.%__cause all this was in his thesis .__c1
__s__and i was on his thesis committee .__c1
__b__and so i r- - really knew this at one time .__c1
__s__ugh .__c5
__s^bk^t3|s^t3__but i - i - it's not only uh is - part of what i haven't figured out yet is - is how all this goes together .__c1
__fg__so i'll dig up some more stuff from dekai .__c1
__s__and - so why don't we just do the uh ?==__c1
__s^aa__okay .__c3
__s__so ==__c3
__s^e__should i - is there a white board here that i can use ?__c3
__b__yeah | you could ==__c1
__s__uh ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__or shall i just use this ?__c3
__s^df__squealing sound .__c1
__s^ng__it's probably just as easy .__c1
__s__i- ==__c1
__qy^d^g__yeah .__c5
__s^2__yeah .__c3
__b__you can put the microphone in your pocket .__c0
__s__hey .__c3
__s__i was envying you and your pocket .__c0
__b__cause i don't have one .__c0
__s^r__it was a quick one | huh ?__c4
__s.%--__that's why they invented pocket t. 's .__c1
__b__they have clips .__c4
__b__exactly .__c0
__b__huh .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__so um - | recall that uh - we want to have this kind of structure in our bayes-nets .__c3
__b__namely that um - you have these nodes that have several bands | right ?__c3
__b__so ==__c3
__s__does i mean they sort of ==__c3
__s^bk|s^rt.%--__the typical example is that um these are all a bunch of cues for something .__c3
__s^aa__and this is a certain effect that we'd like to conclude .__c3
__s^aa__so uh ==__c3
__s.%-__like let's just look at the case when um this is actually the - the final action | right ?__c3
__b__so this is like uh you know touch .__c3
__s__y- ==__c2
__s^r__or ==__c3
__s^m^na__sorry .__c3
__s^df__e.  - eva .__c2
__b__uh ==__c3
__b__@@ .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__b__e.  - e. v. a | right ?__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__b__enter v- - view approach | right ?__c3
__s__w- - what was this ?__c5
__qy^d^f^g__it - i- - i- - i- - uh i- - uh ==__c5
__s.%-__so this is ==__c3
__s^co__wri- - write it out for- - for ==__c1
__s^co^r__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__i mean ==__c5
__s__enter .__c3
__s__view .__c3
__s^bk__approach .__c3
__fg|qw^rt__okay right .__c5
__h|%--__right ?__c3
__s__so i mean we'd like to - take all these various cues | right ?__c3
__s^na__like the army .__c5
__%--__so this one might be say uh ==__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c5
__s__new terminology .__c4
__s^cs__well let me pick a random one .__c3
__b__huh ?__c2
__b__i haven't heard that before .__c4
__s__and say uh ==__c3
__%-__i don't know .__c3
__fh__it could be like this isn't the way it really is .__c3
__s^cs__but let me say - that suppose someone mentioned uh admission fees ==__c3
__b__uh it takes too long .__c3
__qy^rt__try - let me just say landmark .__c3
__h__if the thing is a landmark you know um - then there's another thing that says if um ==__c3
__%--__if it's closed or not at the moment ==__c3
__s.%--__all right | so you have nodes .__c3
__s__right ?__c3
__b__and the uh problem that we were having was that you know given n. nodes there's two to the n ==__c3
__s^cs__given n. nodes and furthermore the fact that there's three things here we need to specify three times uh two to the n probabilities .__c3
__s^df.%--__right ?__c3
__s^df.%--__that's assuming these are all binary which f- - they may not be .__c3
__s^2__for example they could be time of day .__c3
__s^ar__in which case we could uh say you know morning afternoon evening night .__c3
__s^df^nd__so this could be more .__c3
__s^bk__so it's a lot anyway .__c3
__b__and that's a lot of probabilities to put here which is kind of a pain .__c3
__s__so | noisy-ors are a way to uh sort of deal with this .__c3
__fh__um ==__c3
__s^e__where should i put this ?__c3
__s.%--__so the idea is that um let's call these uh c. one c. two c. three and c. four and e.  for cause and effect i guess .__c3
__s^bk|s^e__the idea is to have these intermediate nodes .__c3
__s__right .__c3
__s^cs__well actually the idea first of all is that each of these things has a - quote unquote distinguished state .__c3
__b__which means that this is the state in which we don't really know anything about it .__c3
__s^df__so ==__c3
__b__right ?__c3
__b__so for example if we don't really know if the thing is a landmark or not or i- - if that just doesn't seem relevant then that would be th- - sort of the disting- - the distinguish state .__c3
__s^cs__it's a really you know if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee ==__c3
__s__you know if they didn't talk about it that would be the distinguish state .__c3
__s^cs__so ==__c3
__b__s- - so this is a fanciful way of saying default ?__c2
__b__yeah yeah .__c3
__b__okay .__c2
__b__that's just what they - the word they used in that paper .__c3
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c2
__s.%-__so the idea is that um you have these intermediate nodes | right ?__c3
__s^e^m^na__e. one e. two e. three and e. four .__c3
__s^df__so this is the heckerman paper you're working with .__c1
__s.%-__yeah .__c3
__b__good .__c1
__s^aa__so the idea is that each of these e. i is represents what this would be if all the other ones were in the distinguish state | right ?__c3
__s__so for example suppose that the person - i mean suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark .__c3
__s^bk__but none of the other - sort of cues really apply .__c3
__b__then this would be ==__c3
__s^bk__w- - the this would just represent the probability distribution of this ==__c3
__b__assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply .__c3
__b__so you know if it is a landmark and no- - none of the other things really ap- - applicable then - this would represent the probability distribution .__c3
__s.%-__so maybe in this case maybe we just t- - k- - maybe we decide that if the thing's a landmark and we don't know anything else then we're going to conclude that um they want to view it with probability you know point four .__c3
__s^na__they want to enter it with probability uh with probability point five .__c3
__qy^bu^d__and they want to approach it probability point one say .__c3
__s^aa__right ?__c3
__s__so we come up with these l- - little tables for each of those .__c3
__qy.%-__okay ?__c3
__s^no__and the final thing is that um this is a deterministic function of these .__c3
__s__so we don't need to specify any probabilities .__c3
__s.%--__we just have to um say what function this is | right ?__c3
__b__so we can let this be um g.  of e. one comma e. two e. three e. four | right .__c3
__fh__and our example g.  would be um a majority vote .__c3
__s__right ?__c3
__s^bk^rt__well | okay so th- - so the important point is w- - not what the g.  function is .__c1
__qy^bu.%-__the important point is that um there is a - a - a general kind of idea of shortcutting the full c. p. t .__c1
__s^aa__th- - c- - the full conditional probability table - with some function .__c1
__b__okay .__c1
__b__which y- - w- - you choose appropriately for each case .__c1
__fg|s__so depending on what your situation is there are different functions which are most appropriate .__c1
__%__and ==__c1
__qy^d^rt__so i gave - uh - bhaskara a copy of this uh - sort of ninety two paper .__c1
__s^df__uhhuh .__c3
__s^na__d- - and you got one robert .__c1
__s^bk|s__i don't know who else has seen it .__c1
__s^e__there's - i mean ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__it's heckerman and breese .__c3
__s__it's short .__c1
__s__it's short .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__s__so i- - u- - w- - um yo- - uh - you - have you read it yet ?__c1
__s__uh you can - yeah you should take a look at it i guess .__c3
__s^bk__okay | so you should take a look .__c1
__s^bu__okay .__c0
__s__nancy i'm sure you read it at some point in life .__c1
__b__i ==__c4
__s^df__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__i - i think so | yeah .__c4
__%__okay .__c1
__s^df__and - so you other guys can decide how interested ==__c1
__s__yeah @@ .__c4
__b__anyway | so the paper isn't th- - isn't real hard .__c1
__%--__okay .__c5
__fh|s^df__and uh ==__c1
__b__one of the questions just come at bhaskara is how much of this does javabayes support ?__c1
__s^df__yeah | it's a good question .__c3
__b__um | the - so what we want is basically javabayes to support deterministic uh functions .__c3
__b__right .__c1
__b__and um - in a sense it sup- - we can make it supported by um manually uh entering you know probabilities that are one and zeros | right ?__c3
__fh__right | so the little handout that - the little thing that i sent ==__c1
__s.%--__i sent a message saying uh here is a way to take ==__c1
__s^no__one thing you could do which is kind of s- - in a way stupid is take this deterministic function and use it to build the c. p. t .__c1
__s.%--__so if ba- - javabayes won't do it for you .__c1
__s^no__huh .__c2
__fh__that you can convert all that into what the c. p. t would be .__c1
__qy__um - | and what i sent out about a week ago was an idea of how to do that for um evidence combination .__c1
__s^j__so one of - one function that you could use as your g.  function is an e- - e- - evidence combining .__c1
__%__so you just take the uh if each of th- - if each of the ones has its own little table like that then you could take the uh strength of each of those times its little table .__c1
__fg__and you'd add up the total evidence for v.  e.  and a.  .__c1
__s^j__huh .__c3
__s.%-__i don't think you can do this .__c3
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c4
__fh__because g.  is a function from that to that .__c3
__%--__yep .__c1
__s^ar|s^nd__right .__c1
__s^bk__right ?__c3
__fh|s^cc__so there's no numbers .__c3
__s^bk__there's just quadruplets of - well n. duplets of uh e. v.'s .__c3
__s^fa^j__i- - i- - i- ==__c1
__s^j:s__no no - | but i'm saying is - there there is a w- ==__c1
__s^j__i mean if y- - if - if you decide what's - what is appropriate is probablistic evidence combination you can write a function that does it .__c1
__b__it's a pui- - it's actually one of the examples he's got in there .__c1
__s^j__but anyway s- - skipping - skipping the question of exactly which functions .__c1
__s__now is it clear that you might like to be able to shortcut the whole conditional probability table ?__c1
__s.%-__i mean in some - it seems very plausible in some sense where we will be likely to not be - observe some of the stuff .__c2
__s^df__because we don't have the a- - access to the information .__c2
__s__oops sorry .__c3
__b__right .__c1
__s^aa__that's one of the problems is w- - is - is where would th- - where would it all come from ?__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__%-__so ==__c2
__s__is ==__c3
__s__huh .__c4
__s.%--__oh right .__c3
__b__w- - would not be ab- - able to observe ==__c3
__s^aa__what ?__c3
__s^df.%--__i- - if it's a - a - a discar- - discourse initial phrase we will have nothing in the discourse history .__c2
__s__so if - if we ever want to wonder what was mention- ==__c2
__fg__oh .__c3
__%__oh | a- - are you saying that we'll not be able to observe certain nodes ?__c3
__b.%__that's fine .__c3
__s:s__that is sort of orthogonal thing .__c3
__s.%--__yeah | so there's - there's two separate things robert .__c1
__b__the f- - the - the - the bayes-nets in general are quite good at saying if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that .__c1
__fg|s.%--__okay | th- - that's what they're real good at .__c1
__s^na__so if you don't have any information about the discourse you just use your priors of - of whatever uh- - the - discourse ==__c1
__s^cs^j__uh ==__c1
__%__uh basically whatever w- - it's - probabilistically whatever it would be .__c1
__s__and it's - it's sort of not a great estimate .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__but it's the best one you have .__c1
__s.%--__and so forth .__c1
__s^df__so that they're good at .__c1
__s^cs.%--__but the other problem is how do you fill in all these numbers ?__c1
__b__and i think that's the one he was getting at .__c1
__s^2__uhhuh .__c4
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__fh__so specifically in this case you have to - f- - have this many numbers .__c3
__s^df__whereas in this case you just have to have three for this three for this three for this | right ?__c3
__fg__so you have to have just three n.  .__c3
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c2
__s^bk__so this is much smaller than that .__c3
__s^df__asymptotically .__c0
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c4
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__well pretty quickly .__c1
__s^aa__right .__c3
__b__u- ==__c0
__s^df__yeah yeah .__c0
__s^df__so you don't need da- - data enough to cover - uh nearly as much stuff .__c4
__b__i mean ==__c1
__b__i don't know .__c3
__b__so really i- - what a - a noisy or seems to kind of neural-net-acize these bayes-nets .__c0
__s^df__uh - well- - to- - some- ==__c1
__b__no no .__c1
__s^no__so noisy or is a funny way of referring to this .__c1
__s^df__because the noisy or is only one instance .__c1
__s^bk__yeah | this isn't a noisy or anymore .__c3
__s__that one actually isn't a noisy or .__c1
__fh__so we'll have to think of - of a way t- - t- ==__c1
__s.%-__yeah .__c0
__qy.%-__it's a noisy-arg-max or a noisy whatever .__c3
__s__yeah | whatever .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c1
__fg|s^ng__so uh um ==__c1
__s.%-__well my point was more that we just - uh ==__c0
__s^df__with the neural net right uh things come in you have a function that combines them .__c0
__b__and ==__c0
__s^bk__yeah | it - it - tha- - that's true .__c1
__s^e__it is a- - is also more neural net like although uh it isn't necessarily sum uh s- - you know sum of weights or anything like that .__c1
__s^bk__right .__c0
__fh|qy__i mean i- - you could have ==__c1
__qy__uh like the noisy or function really is one that's essentially says uh take the max .__c1
__s__well the or .__c3
__s__same .__c1
__fg__right | i guess you're right .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^df__uh ==__c1
__b__but anyway ==__c1
__s.%--__so ==__c1
__s__and i thi- - i think that's the standard way people get around the uh ==__c1
__s^e__there are a couple other ones .__c1
__b__there are ways of breaking this up into s- - to - to subnets and stuff like that .__c1
__%-__but um ==__c1
__s__the ==__c1
__s^am__i think we definitely - i think it's a great idea tha- - to - to pursue that .__c1
__s.%-__yep .__c3
__b__so ==__c3
__s^df__wha- - still sort of leaves one question .__c2
__s^r.%--__it - i mean you - you can always uh - see easily that - that i'm not grasping everything correctly .__c2
__b__but what seemed attractive to me in im- - uh in the last discussion we had was that we find out a means of - of getting these point four point five point one of c. four .__c2
__fh__not because you know a.  is a landmark or not but we - we - we label this whatever object type .__c2
__s__and if it's a garden it's point three point four point two .__c2
__s^df__if it's a castle it's point eight point one point one .__c2
__s^df__if it's uh a town hall it's point two point three point five .__c2
__b__right .__c1
__b__and so forth .__c2
__s^df__and we don't want to write this down necessarily every time for something .__c2
__s^bk__but uh ==__c2
__s^cs__it'll be students ==__c3
__fh__let's see .__c2
__s^aa__where else would it be stored ?__c3
__b__that's the question .__c3
__s^cs__well in the beginning we'll write up a flat file .__c2
__%-__we know we have twenty object types .__c2
__s^df__oh .__c1
__s^aa__yeah ==__c1
__b__and we'll write it down in a flat file .__c2
__s^aa__no ==__c1
__s__so | i- - is- ==__c1
__%-__well let me say something guys .__c1
__b__because there's not - there's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now .__c1
__s^ba^cs__uhhuh .__c3
__s^2__which is the hierarchy that s- - comes with the ontology is just what you want for this .__c1
__s^aa__so that uh if you know about it - let's say a particular town hall that it's one that is a monument then that would be stored there .__c1
__s^aa__if you don't you look up the hierarchy ==__c1
__s^df__uh - so you - you - you may or - so then you'd have this little vector of um you know approach mode or e. v. a mode .__c1
__b__let's - okay so we have the e. v. a vector for - for various kinds of landmarks .__c1
__b__if you know it for a specific landmark you put it there .__c1
__fh__if you don't you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one .__c1
__fg__okay .__c3
__s.%--__so is the idea to put it in the ontology ?__c3
__fh__absolutely .__c1
__s__okay .__c3
__s__uh or link to .__c1
__s^bk__or ==__c1
__fh__but - but in any case - i- - view it logically as being in the ontology .__c1
__fh__it's part of what you know about a - an object is its e. v. a vector .__c1
__s.%--__okay .__c3
__%--__uhhuh .__c3
__%__and if yo- - as i say if you know about a specific object you put it there .__c1
__s__this is part of what dekai was doing .__c1
__qy^rt__so when we get to wu the- - e- - we'll see w- - what he says about that .__c1
__fh__right .__c3
__%-__and then if you - if it isn't there it's higher .__c1
__qy.%--:s^co.%--__and if you don't know anything except that it's a b- - it's - it's a - building then up at the highest thing you have the pr- - what amounts to a prior .__c1
__qrr.%--__if you don't know anything else about a building uh you just take whatever your crude approximation is up at that level .__c1
__h__right .__c3
__h|s__which might be equal or whatever it is .__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__so that's a very pretty relationship between these local vectors and the ontology .__c1
__s__and it seems to me the obvious thing to do unless we find a reason to do something different .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__b__does this make sense to you ?__c1
__s__so ==__c3
__s__bhask- ?==__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^df:s__so we are - but we - we're not doing the ontology .__c3
__b__so we have to get to whoever is doing the - u- - ultimately ==__c3
__s^ar|s^nd__indeed .__c1
__s^bk__we have to get them to ==__c3
__qy^d^rt__so that's another thing we're going to need to do is - is to either ==__c1
__s.%-__we're going to need some way to either get a p- - tag in the ontology or add fields .__c1
__s__or some way to associate ==__c1
__s.%-__or w- - it may be that all we can do is um some of our own hash tables that it ==__c1
__s^bk__th- - the - th- - you know there's always a way to do that .__c1
__qw^br^rt__it's a just a question of ==__c1
__s:s__i- ==__c1
__s__yeah | hash on object name to you know uh the probabilities or whatever .__c0
__b__th- ==__c1
__b__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__e- ==__c1
__s^aa__right .__c1
__s__and so ==__c1
__%-__i- ==__c1
__fh__uh ==__c1
__s.%-__but it's uh - well it strikes me as a what for- ==__c2
__s.%-__if we get the mechanism that will be sort of the wonderful part .__c2
__s:s^co__and then how to make it work is - is the second part .__c2
__b__in the sense that i mean m- - the guy who was doing the ontology uh uh s- - ap- - apologized that i- - it will take him another through two to three days .__c2
__s__because they're having really trouble getting the upper level straight .__c2
__b__and ==__c2
__s__right now .__c2
__s^ba__the reason is given the craw bet uh the - the - the projects that all carry their own taxonomy and on all history they're really trying to build one top level ontology ft- - that covers all the e. m. l projects .__c2
__s__and that's uh uh sort of a tough cookie .__c2
__s.%-__a little bit tougher than they figured .__c2
__s^df__i could have told them s- - so .__c2
__fg__right .__c1
__s:s^cs__uh ==__c2
__s__yeah .__c1
__s:s^bk__but nevertheless it's going to be there by n- - by uh next monday .__c2
__s:s__and i will show you what's - what some examples from that for towers and stuff .__c2
__s:s__and um ==__c2
__s^aa__what i don't think is ever going to be in the ontology is sort of you know the likelihood of uh people entering r- - town halls and looking at town halls and approaching town halls .__c2
__qy^j^rt__especially since we are b- - dealing with a case based .__c2
__qy^j^r^rt__not an instance based ontology .__c2
__s__so there will be nothing on - on that town hall or on the berkeley town hall or on the heidelberg town hall .__c2
__b__it'll just be information on town halls .__c2
__qy^d^rt:s__well they - they - they - how ar- - what are they going to do with instances ?__c1
__%--__but what ==__c2
__fh__i mean you - y- ==__c1
__b__well that's ==__c2
__b__hhh .__c2
__fg__that's - that's al- - different question .__c2
__s^bk__i mean th- - the - first they had to make a design question do we take ontologies that have instances ?__c2
__s^cs__or just one that does not that just has the types ?__c2
__%--__okay .__c1
__b__and so since the d- - decision was on types on a d- - simply type based we now have to hook it up to instances .__c2
____i mean this is ==__c2
____one ==__c2
____but what i- - what is smartkom going to do about that ?__c1
____because they have instances all the time .__c1
____yeah | but the ontology is really not a smartkom thing .__c2
____in - in and of itself .__c2
____that's more something that i kicked loose in - in e. m. l .__c2
____so it's a completely e. m. l thing .__c2
__s__but uh - uh - smartkom's going to need an ontology .__c1
__s^t3__yes | u- - a w- - a lot of people are aware of that .__c2
__s__i understand | but is anybody doing anything about it ?__c1
__s__um ==__c2
__s__okay .__c1
__fh__it's a political problem .__c1
__s__we won't worry about it .__c1
__s^df__no | but - th- - the r- - uh - i th- - i still think that there is enough information in there .__c2
__s^df.%--__for example whether ==__c2
__s^cs__okay so th- - it will know about the twenty object types there are in the world .__c2
__fg__let's assume there are only twenty object types in this world .__c2
__s__and it will know if any of those have institutional meanings .__c2
__b__so in a sense i used as institutions for some s- - in some sense or the other .__c2
__fg__which makes them enterable | right ?__c2
__%--__in a sense .__c2
__s^ba__you know .__c2
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__anyway | so we may have to ==__c1
__qw__yep .__c2
__s^bk__this is with the whole thing .__c1
__s^bk__we may have to build another data stru- ==__c1
__s^df__yep .__c2
__b__conceptually we know what should be done .__c1
__fh|s__when we see what people have done it may turn out that the easiest thing to do is to build a - a separate thing that - that just pools i- - i- ==__c1
__s^df__like i- - i- - it - it may be that the - the instance ==__c1
__fh__w- - that we have to build our own instance uh things that with their types .__c1
__s__yeah | it's ==__c3
__b__right | we can just assume ==__c3
__s|qy^d^g__and then it goes off to the ontology once you have its type .__c1
__s^df.%--__so we build a little data structure .__c1
__s^bk|s__and so what we would do in that case is in our instance gadget have our e. v. a.'s .__c1
__s^aa__and if we- - d- - there isn't one we'd get the type .__c1
__s^df__and then have the e. v. a.'s for the type .__c1
__b__so we'd have our own little uh e. v. a tree .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__s^cs__and then for other uh vectors that we need .__c1
__b__right .__c3
__b__so we'd have our own little things so that whenever we needed one we'd just use the ontology to get the type .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__%__and then would hash or whatever we do to say uh !__c1
__fh__if it's that type of thing and we want its e. v. a vector pppt-pppt it's that .__c1
__s.%--__so i- - i think we can handle that .__c1
__s__and then - but the combination functions and whether we can put those in java bayes and all that sort of stuff is uh - is the bigger deal .__c1
__s^cs__yeah .__c3
__s^df__i think that's where we have to get technically clever .__c1
__fh__um ==__c3
__s^ng__we could just steal the classes in javabayes and then interface to them with our own code .__c0
__b__well i me- - ye uh yeah the ==__c1
__s^aa__that requires understanding the classes in javabayes i guess .__c3
__s.%-__yeah | i mean it's uh e- - e- - e- - e- - e- - cute .__c1
__s__i mean you've been around enough to ==__c1
__b__i mean ==__c1
__s^bk__just .__c1
__s__well it depends on ==__c0
__b__i mean there's this huge package which - which may or may not be consistent .__c1
__fg|%-__and ==__c1
__s__you know .__c1
__s__but yeah | we could look at it .__c1
__s^aa__well i was j- ==__c0
__b__okay yeah .__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^cs.%--__it's b- - it ==__c1
__s.%--__it's an inter- - sort of a kind of a - it ==__c1
__b__the thing is it's kind of an interpreter .__c1
__s^aa__and i- - i- - it expects its data structures to be in a given form .__c1
__s^df__and if you say hey we're going to make a different kind of data structure to stick in there ==__c1
__%--__well no but that just means there's a protocol .__c0
__b__right ?__c0
__fg|s.%--__that you could ==__c0
__s__it may or may not .__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__i don't know .__c1
__%-__that's the question is to what extent does it allow us to put in these g.  functions ?__c1
__b__and i don't know .__c1
__s^cs__well no | but - i mean - what i uh the ==__c0
__b__so you could have four different bayes-nets that you're running .__c0
__s.%--__and then run your own - write your own function that would take the output of those four .__c0
__b__and make your own g.  function is what i was saying .__c0
__s^aa__yeah | that's fine .__c1
__s^cs__if it's - if it comes only at the end .__c1
__s.%--__but suppose you want it embedded ?__c1
__s^cs__well then you'd have to break all of your bayes-nets into smaller bayes-nets .__c0
__s^cs__with all the ==__c0
__b__oh that ==__c1
__s^aa__yeah | that's a truly horrible way to do d- - it .__c1
__s^df^na__one would hope ==__c1
__s^e__yeah | but i'm just ==__c0
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c2
__s__yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah | you bet .__c1
__s^aa__but at that point you may say hey java bayes isn't the only package in town .__c1
__s^aa__let's see if there's another package that's uh more civilized about this .__c1
__s^na__@@ .__c3
__s^aa__now srini is worth talking to on this .__c1
__s^df__huh .__c3
__fh__because he said that he actually did hack some combining functions into javabayes .__c1
__s^df__uh .__c3
__s^aa__but he doesn't remember - at least when i talked to him he didn't remember whether it was an e- - an easy thing a natural thing or whether he had to do some violence to it to make it work .__c1
__s__uh ==__c1
__s^fa__but he did do it .__c1
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__fg|s__i don't see why the uh combining f- - functions have to be directly hacked into javabayes .__c3
__s^df__i mean they're used to create tables .__c3
__b__so we can just make our own little functions that create tables in x. m. l .__c3
__s__well i say that's one way to do it is - is to just convert it int- - into a - into a c. p. t that you zip .__c1
__s^df__it's blown up .__c1
__b__and is a - it's uh - it's huge .__c1
__fg__but it doesn't require any data fitting or complication .__c1
__s^bu__uhhuh .__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__s:s__i don't think - i mean the fact that it blown u- - blows up is a huge issue in the sense that ==__c3
__s^na__i mean okay .__c3
__s.%--__so say it blows up | right ?__c3
__fh|s^na__so there's like the you know ten f- - ten fifteen uh things .__c3
__s^df__it's going to be like two to the that .__c3
__s^df__which isn't so bad .__c3
__s^df__i- - i understand .__c1
__b__i'm just saying tha- - that w- ==__c1
__s.%--__that was wi- - that was my note .__c1
__s^e__the little note i sent said that .__c1
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__it said here's the way you'd take the logical f- - g.  function and turn it into a c. p. t .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^aa__i mean that - the max- - the evidence combining function .__c1
__b__so we could do that .__c1
__fh__and maybe that's what we'll do .__c1
__qw^rt__but um ==__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__don't know .__c1
__s^na__so i will e- - e- - before next week uh @@ p- - push - push some more on - on this stuff that dekai wu did .__c1
__s^aa__and try to understand it .__c1
__qy__uh you'll make a couple of more copies of the heckerman paper to give to people .__c1
__h|s^aap__p- - sure .__c3
__s^df__yeah | i - i would like a copy .__c5
__b__y- - y- - yeah .__c5
__fh|s.%--__okay .__c3
__s^bk__okay .__c1
__s^bk__and um ==__c1
__fh__okay .__c5
__s__i think ==__c1
__fh__okay | and i- - i'll - i'll think s- - through this uh uh - getting eva vectors dynamically out of ontologies one more time .__c2
__s__because i s- - i - i - i'm not quite sure whether we all think of the same thing or not here .__c2
__s__well you and i should talk about it .__c1
__s__yeah uhhuh .__c2
__fh__okay .__c2
__fg|%--__all right | great .__c1
__b__and robert thank you for coming in under ==__c1
__s__he - he's been sick .__c1
__s^bu^rt__robert .__c1
__%-__und ==__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__qy^g__i was thinking maybe we should just cough into the microphone and see if they can't - th- - see if they can handle it .__c0
__s^aa__yep .__c3
__s^na__sure .__c4
__b__um - | is this uh ?==__c2
