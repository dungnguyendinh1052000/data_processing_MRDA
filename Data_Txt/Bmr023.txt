__z__hello ?__c4
__z__okay | we're on .__c1
__z__okay | so uh - had some interesting mail from uh - dan ellis .__c0
__z__actually i think he - he redirected it to everybody also .__c0
__z__so uh - the p d a mikes uh - have a big bunch of energy at - at uh - five hertz .__c0
__z__uh ==__c0
__z__where this came up was that uh - i was showing off these wave forms that we have on the web .__c0
__z__and - and uh - | i just sort of hadn't noticed this but that - the major - major component in the wave - in the second wave form in that pair of wave forms is actually the air conditioner .__c0
__z__huh .__c2
__z__so ==__c0
__z__so ==__c0
__z__i - i have to be more careful about using that as a - as a - as a good illustration .__c0
__z__uh in fact it's not of uh of the effects of room reverberation .__c0
__z__it is- - isn't a bad illustration of the effects of uh - room noise on - on uh - some mikes .__c0
__z__uh but ==__c0
__z__so ==__c0
__z__and then we had this other discussion about um - whether this affects the dynamic range .__c0
__z__because i know although we start off with thirty two bits you end up with uh - sixteen bits .__c0
__z__and you know are we getting hurt there ?__c0
__z__but uh - dan is pretty confident that we're not that - that quantization error is not - is still not a significant factor there .__c0
__z__so ==__c0
__z__so there was a question of whether we should change things here .__c0
__z__whether we should change a capacitor on the input box for that .__c0
__z__or whether we should ==__c0
__z__yeah | he suggested a smaller capacitor .__c1
__z__right ?__c1
__z__for the p d a's ?__c1
__z__right .__c0
__z__but then i had some other uh - thing- - discussions with him .__c0
__z__and the feeling was once we start monk- - monkeying with that uh - many other problems could ha- - happen .__c0
__z__and additionally we - we already have a lot of data that's been collected with that .__c0
__z__so ==__c0
__z__yeah .__c1
__z__a simple thing to do is ==__c0
__z__he - he - he has a - i forget if it - this was in that mail or in the following mail .__c0
__z__but he has a - a simple filter a digital filter that he suggested .__c0
__z__we just run over the data before we deal with it .__c0
__z__uhhuh .__c1
__z__um - | the other thing that i don't know the answer to but when people are using feacalc here uh - whether they're using it with the high pass filter option or not .__c0
__z__and i don't know if anybody knows .__c0
__s^t^tc__um - | i could go check .__c4
__qy^rt__but ==__c0
__s^na__yeah .__c0
__s^bk__so when we're doing all these things using our software there is ==__c0
__qy__um - if it's - if it's based on the rasta p l p program which does both p l p and rasta p l p um - then uh - there is an option there which then comes up through to feacalc which um - allows you to do high pass filtering .__c0
__qrr.%--__and in general we like to do that because of things like this .__c0
__s^na__and it's - it's pretty - it's not a very severe .__c0
__b__filter doesn't affect speech frequencies .__c0
__s.%--__even pretty low speech frequencies at all .__c0
__%-__but it's ==__c0
__s^aa__what's the cutoff frequency it used ?__c1
__s^aa__oh .__c0
__s__i don't know .__c0
__s^cs__i wrote this a while ago .__c0
__s^ba__is it like twenty ?__c1
__s^t__something like that .__c0
__s^df__yeah .__c1
__fh|s^no.%--__yeah .__c0
__s__i mean i think there's some effect above twenty .__c0
__s__but it's - it's - it's - it's mild .__c0
__qy^d^rt__so i mean it probably - there's probably some effect up to a hundred hertz or something but it's - it's pretty mild .__c0
__fg|s__i don't know in the - in the strut implementation of the stuff is there a high pass filter or a pre- - pre emphasis or something in the ?==__c0
__s^e^rt__uh - | i think we use a pre emphasis .__c5
__qy^rt__yeah .__c5
__s^rt__yeah .__c5
__b__so we - we - we want to go and check that in i- - for anything that we're going to use the p d a mike for .__c0
__b__uh - he says that there's a pretty good roll off in the p z m mikes .__c0
__s.%-__so we don't need - need to worry about them one way or the other .__c0
__s^co^t3__but if we do make use of the cheap mikes uh - we want to be sure to do that - that filtering before we process it .__c0
__b__and then again if it's ==__c0
__s^co__uh - depending on the option that the - our - our software is being run with it's - it's quite possible that's already being taken care of .__c0
__s^co__uh - but i also have to pick a different picture to show the effects of reverberation .__c0
__s^df__uh ==__c0
__fh__did somebody notice it during your talk ?__c1
__s^bu__uh - | no .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__huh .__c1
__s^bk__well ==__c0
__fg__uh ==__c0
__fh__well | if they made output .__c0
__qw^t^tc__they were - they were you know they were nice .__c0
__s__didn't say anything ?__c1
__s^ar|s__but i mean the thing is it was ==__c0
__s^bk__since i was talking about reverberation and showing this thing that was noise it wasn't a good match .__c0
__s^na__but it certainly was still uh - an indication of the fact that you get noise with distant mikes .__c0
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c1
__s^bk__uh - it's just not a great example because not only isn't it reverberation but it's a noise that we definitely know what to do .__c0
__s^df__so i mean it doesn't take deep - a new - bold new methods to get rid of uh - five hertz noise .__c0
__fh__so ==__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__fh__um - uh - but ==__c0
__s^ba__so it was - it was a bad example in that way .__c0
__s^bk__but it's - it still is - it's the real thing that we did get out of the microphone at distance .__c0
__qr.%-__so it wasn't it w- - it w- - wasn't wrong it was inappropriate .__c0
__s__so - so uh - but uh ==__c0
__s^aa__yeah | someone noticed it later pointed it out to me and i went oh man .__c0
__fh__why didn't i notice that .__c0
__qw.%-__huh .__c1
__b__um - so - um ==__c0
__s__so i think we'll change our - our picture on the web when we're @reject@ ==__c0
__fg|s^cs__one of the things i was - i mean i was trying to think about what - what's the best way to show the difference an- - and i had a couple of thoughts .__c0
__s^aa^m__one was that spectrogram that we show is okay .__c0
__s^cs__but the thing is the eyes uh - and the the brain behind them are so good at picking out patterns from - from noise that in first glance .__c0
__s^rt__you look at them it doesn't seem like it's that bad .__c0
__s^am__uh - because there's many features that are still preserved .__c0
__s^no__so one thing to do might be to just take a piece of the spec- - uh - of the spectrogram where you can see that something looks different .__c0
__s.%--__an- - and blow it up and have that be the part that's - just to show as well .__c0
__s__uhhuh uhhuh .__c1
__s^e^m__you know .__c0
__s^e__i- - i- - some things are going to be hurt .__c0
__s__um - another i was thinking of was um - taking some spectral slices .__c0
__s^aa__like uh - like we look at with the recognizer .__c0
__b__and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there .__c0
__s^co^na__and the - the uh - um - the reverberation uh - does make it - does change that .__c0
__s^j__huh .__c1
__s^bk__and so maybe - maybe that would be more obvious .__c0
__s^co__spectral slices ?__c2
__s^2^j__yeah .__c0
__b__w- - w- - what d- - what do you mean ?__c2
__b__well i mean um - all the recognizers look at frames .__c0
__b__so like one instant in time .__c1
__s^ba^j__so they - they look at ==__c0
__fh|qy^t^tc__okay .__c2
__s^df__yeah | look at a ==__c0
__s^na^t__so it's ==__c0
__fh__yeah .__c0
__s^bk__at one point in time or uh - twenty - over twenty milliseconds or something you have a spectrum or a cepstrum .__c0
__qw__okay .__c2
__h|s^t__that's what i meant by a slice .__c0
__s^m__i see .__c2
__s^bk^rt__yeah .__c0
__fh__and if you look at ==__c0
__qy^rt__you could just - you could just throw up you know uh - the uh - some m f c c feature vectors .__c1
__s^na__you know one from one one from the other and then you know you can look and see how different the numbers are .__c1
__qy__right | well that's why i saying .__c0
__s^e.%--__i'm just kidding .__c1
__s.%--__either well either spectrum or cepstrum .__c0
__fg__but - but i think the thing is you want to ==__c0
__qy^rt__i don't mean a graph .__c1
__s^nd__oh .__c0
__s^bu^m__i mean the actual numbers .__c1
__s^aa__oh i see .__c0
__s__oh .__c0
__s^aa__that would be lovely .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__yeah .__c1
__b__yeah .__c0
__fg|s^ba__see how different these sequences of numbers are .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c0
__s.%-__or i could just add them up and get a different total .__c0
__s^2__yeah .__c1
__s^aa^m__it's not the square .__c1
__b__okay .__c0
__s__uh- - what else - wh- - what's - what else is going on ?__c0
__s__uh - | yeah .__c5
__fh|s__yeah | at first i had a remark .__c5
__fh__why - i am wondering why the p d a is always so far .__c5
__fh|s^ba__i mean we are always meeting at the beginning of the table and the p d a's there .__c5
__b__uh - | i guess because we haven't wanted to move it .__c0
__s^df__we - we could - we could move us .__c0
__s^j__yeah ?__c5
__b__and ==__c0
__s^co__okay .__c5
__s^bk^rt__that's right .__c4
__s__well anyway .__c5
__b__um ==__c5
__s^fe__yeah | so ==__c5
__s^bk|s^ba__uh - | since the last meeting we've - we've tried to put together um - the clean low pass um - downsampling upsampling i mean .__c5
__b__uh - the new filter that's replacing the l d a filters .__c5
__b__and also the um - delay issue .__c5
__fg__so that ==__c5
__fh__we considered th- - the - the delay issue on the - for the online normalization .__c5
__s^cs__huh .__c5
__b__so we've put together all this .__c5
__s^df__and then we have results that are not um - very impressive .__c5
__b__well there is no real improvement .__c5
__s^cs.%-__but it's not wer- - worse .__c0
__b__it's not ==__c5
__s^co^t3__and it's better - better latency .__c0
__%-__right ?__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah .__c5
__s^e.%-__yeah .__c5
__fg|s^bk__well actually it's better .__c5
__s^ba__it seems better when we look at the mismatched case .__c5
__s^aa__but i think we are like - like cheated here by the - th- - this problem .__c5
__s^aa__that uh - in some cases when you modify slight - slightly modify the initial condition you end up completely somewhere air- - somewhere else in the - in the space the parameters .__c5
__b__yeah .__c0
__b__so ==__c5
__s__well the other system are for instance ==__c5
__b__for italian is at seventy eight percent recognition rate on the mismatch .__c5
__b__and this new system has eighty nine .__c5
__s^cs.%-__but i don't think it indicates something really .__c5
__b__i don't - i don't think it means that the new system is more robust ==__c5
__s^ba__uhhuh .__c0
__s^df__or ==__c5
__b__it's simply the fact that ==__c5
__s^aa__well ==__c5
__s^aa__well the test would be if you then tried it on one of the other test sets if - if it was ==__c0
__s^df__y- ==__c5
__fg__right | so this was italian .__c0
__b__right ?__c0
__b__yeah yeah .__c5
__s__so then if you take your changes .__c0
__s^cs__it's similar for other test sets .__c5
__b__and then ==__c0
__s^aa__but i mean from this se- - seventy eight um - percent recognition rate system i could change the transition probabilities for the - the first h m m and it will end up to eighty nine also .__c5
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c0
__s^cs.%--__by using point five instead of point six point four as in the - the h t k script .__c5
__fh__uhhuh .__c0
__s__yeah .__c0
__s^e__so well | that's ==__c5
__b__yeah .__c1
__fh__yeah | i looked at um - looked at the results when stephane did that .__c1
__b__well ==__c5
__s__uh - uh ==__c5
__s^aa__and it's - it's really wo- - really happens .__c1
__s^na__this really happens .__c5
__fh__i mean th- - the only difference is you change the self loop transition probability by a tenth of a percent .__c1
__fg__yeah .__c5
__qh^rt^t^tc__yeah .__c0
__qy^d^rt__and it causes ten percent difference in the word error rate .__c1
__s^aa|s__a tenth of a per cent .__c0
__b__even tenth of a percent ?__c5
__fh__yeah .__c1
__s^2^j__from point ==__c1
__fh__well we tried - we tried point one .__c5
__b__i - i'm sorry .__c1
__s^j^m__f- - for point - from - you change at point one .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c5
__s__huh .__c5
__s^cs^e__oh .__c0
__b__and n- - not tenth of a percent one tenth .__c1
__b__all right ?__c1
__s^df__yeah .__c0
__fh|s__um - so from point five ==__c1
__s.%-__so from point six to point five and you get ten percent better .__c1
__qw__uhhuh .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s^ba__and it's - i think it's what you basically hypothesized in the last meeting about uh - it just being very ==__c1
__fh__and i think you mentioned this in your e mail too ==__c1
__s^ba__huh yeah .__c5
__qy^rt__it's just very um ==__c1
__s^aa__you know get stuck in some local minimum .__c1
__s__and this thing throws you out of it i guess .__c1
__qy__uhhuh .__c5
__qrr.%--__well what's - what are - according to the rules what - what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities ?__c0
__s^aa|s__are they supposed to be point five or point six ?__c0
__b__i think you're not allowed to ==__c1
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__that's supposed to be point six for the self loop .__c1
__s^ba__yeah .__c5
__s^ba__point - it's supposed to be point six .__c0
__%-__yeah .__c1
__qh__but changing it to point five i think is ==__c1
__b__which gives you much better results .__c1
__s^ba^j^rt__but that's not allowed .__c1
__s^aa|s.%-__but not allowed .__c0
__s^bk__yeah okay .__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c1
__b__yeah | but even if you use point five i'm not sure it will always give you the better results .__c5
__s__on other test set or it ==__c5
__%-__yeah .__c1
__qy^d^g__right | we only tested it on the - the medium mismatch .__c1
__qy.%-__on the other training set i mean .__c5
__s^cs^j__right ?__c1
__s^am__yeah .__c5
__s^df__you said on the other cases you didn't notice ?==__c1
__s^bk__but i think ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__s^bk__i think the reason is ==__c5
__s^e__yeah i not- - i ==__c5
__s^cc__it was in my mail i think also - is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone .__c5
__s__well in - for the mismatched case everything is um - using the far microphone training and testing .__c5
__s__whereas for the highly mismatched training is done on the close microphone .__c5
__s^cc__so it's - it's clean speech basically .__c5
__s__so you don't have this problem of local minima probably .__c5
__s^bk|qy^rt__and for the well match it's a mix of close microphone and distant microphone .__c5
__b__and ==__c5
__fh__well ==__c5
__h|qy^bu^d^rt__i did notice uh - something ==__c1
__qrr__so th- - i think the mismatch is the more difficult for the training part .__c5
__s__somebody i think it was morgan suggested at the last meeting that i actually count to see how many parameters and how many frames .__c1
__s^no__uhhuh .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__b__and there are uh - almost one point eight million frames of training data .__c1
__fh|s^e__and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system .__c1
__fh|s__huh .__c0
__s__yeah .__c5
__qw.%-__so it's very very few parameters compared to how much training data .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__well yes .__c0
__s^df__so ==__c0
__b__and that - that says that we could have lots more parameters actually .__c0
__b__yeah .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^df__i did one quick experiment just to make sure i had everything worked out .__c1
__b__and i just - uh - f- - for most of the um ==__c1
__fh__for - for all of the digit models they end up at three mixtures per state .__c1
__s^co__and so i just did a quick experiment where i changed it so it went to four .__c1
__fg__and um - it it - it didn't have a r- - any significant effect at the uh - medium mismatch and high mismatch cases .__c1
__%-__and it had - it was just barely significant for the well matched .__c1
__s__better .__c1
__b__uh - so i'm r- - going to run that again but um with many more uh - mixtures per state .__c1
__fh__yeah | because at forty thou- - i mean you could you could have ==__c0
__s^no__uh ==__c0
__fh__yeah | easily four times as many parameters .__c0
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c1
__b__and i think also just seeing what we saw uh - in terms of the expected duration of the silence model ==__c1
__s__when we did this tweaking of the self loop ==__c1
__b__yeah .__c5
__s^ba__the silence model expected duration was really different .__c1
__s^aa__and so in the case where um - it had a better score the silence model expected duration was much longer .__c1
__b__yeah .__c5
__fh__so it was like it was a better match .__c1
__s^cs^t^tc__i think you know if we make a better silence model i think that will help a lot too .__c1
__fg|s__um - for a lot of these cases .__c1
__s^e__so ==__c1
__s__but one - one thing i - i wanted to check out before i increased the um - number of mixtures per state was uh - in their default training script they do an initial set of three re estimations .__c1
__s__and then they built the silence model .__c1
__fh|%--__and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures .__c1
__s^co__and they do another seven then they add mixtures .__c1
__s__then they do a final set of seven and they quit .__c1
__s^df^e__seven seems like a lot to me .__c1
__s.%-__and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time .__c1
__s^j__i mean to do one turnaround of the well matched case takes like a day .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__s^j__uhhuh .__c0
__b__and so you know in trying to run these experiments i notice you know it's difficult to find machines you know compute the run on .__c1
__s^df__and so one of the things i did was i compiled h t k for the linux machines .__c1
__s^df.%-__uhhuh .__c0
__s^j.%-__because we have this one from i b m that's got like five processors in it .__c1
__s^df__right .__c0
__s__and so now i'm - you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we've got you know extra machines that we can use for compute .__c1
__s^df__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__and if - i'm do- - running an experiment right now where i'm changing the number of iterations from seven to three .__c1
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__just to see how it affects the baseline system .__c1
__s^ba__and so if we can get away with just doing three we can do many more experiments more quickly .__c1
__s^bd__and if it's not a - a huge difference from running with seven iterations um - you know we should be able to get a lot more experiments done .__c1
__s^j__huh .__c5
__s.%-__and so i'll let you know what - what happens with that .__c1
__s^j__but if we can you know run all of these back ends f- - with many fewer iterations and on linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting done .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__s^ba__so ==__c1
__s^cc__so i wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before i increased the number of gaussians .__c1
__s__right .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__sorry .__c0
__s^e__so um - how's it going on the ?==__c0
__b__um ==__c5
__s^df__so you - you did some things .__c0
__fh__they didn't improve things in a way that convinced you you'd substantially improved anything .__c0
__s^df__yeah .__c5
__s__but they're not making things worse and we have reduced latency .__c0
__s.%--__right ?__c0
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__but actually - um - actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well matched case .__c5
__s__and we just noticed that ==__c5
__fh__yeah actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny .__c5
__s^cs__it's not a mean of word error rate .__c5
__s__it's not a weighted mean of word error rate .__c5
__s^aa__it's a weighted mean of improvements .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__s__so ==__c5
__s^cs__which means that actually the weight on the well matched is ==__c5
__s^ba__well - i well - what - what - what happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small - if on the well matched case it will have uh - huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference .__c5
__s^bk__because the reference system is - is - is quite good for - for the well ma- - well matched case also .__c5
__b.%__so it - it weights the improvement on the well matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases ?__c1
__s^cs^rt__no | but it's the weighting of the - of the improvement .__c5
__s^cs__not of the error rate .__c5
__s^cs__yeah .__c1
__fg|s^na.%-__yeah | and it's hard to improve on the - on the best case .__c1
__b__because it's already so good .__c1
__s^2__right ?__c1
__s^aa__yeah | but what i mean is that you can have a huge improvement on the h - h m k's .__c5
__s^2^e__uh - like five percent uh - absolute .__c5
__s^aa__and this will not affect the final score almost .__c5
__s__uh - this will almost not affect the final score because this improvement - because the improvement uh - relative to the - the baseline is small .__c5
__s__uh ==__c5
__s__so they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy rather than word error rate ?__c0
__s^bk__uh improvement ==__c5
__s^ba^tc__no | it's compared to the word uh- - it's improvement on the word error rate .__c5
__s.%--__so ==__c0
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__sorry .__c5
__s^aa__okay .__c0
__s__so if you have uh - ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh - improvement then that's fifty percent .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__fh|s__okay | so what you're saying then is that if it's something that has a small word error rate then uh - a - even a relatively small improvement on it in absolute terms will show up as quite - quite large in this .__c0
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c5
__s__is that what you're saying ?__c0
__s__yeah .__c5
__s.%--__yes .__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c5
__s^bu__okay .__c0
__qy^g__but - yeah that's - that's - it's the notion of relative improvement .__c0
__qy.%-__yeah .__c5
__s^aa__word error rate .__c0
__s^na__sure | but when we think about the weighting which is point five point three point two it's on absolute on - on relative figures .__c5
__s.%--__not ==__c5
__s.%--__yeah .__c0
__s__so when we look at this error rate ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c0
__s^cc__no .__c0
__s^cc__uh ==__c5
__fh|s^df__that's why i've been saying we should be looking at word error rate uh - and - and not - not at at accuracies .__c0
__s.%--__huh yeah .__c5
__b__huh yeah .__c5
__b__it's ==__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__s__i mean uh - we probably should have standardized on that all the way through .__c0
__s^aa__it's just ==__c0
__s^ba__well ==__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s^ba__i mean it's not - it's not that different .__c1
__fh__right ?__c1
__fh|s^cs__i mean just subtract the accuracy .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c0
__qy^rt__i mean ==__c1
__s^cs.%--__but you're - but when you look at the numbers your sense of the relative size of things is quite different .__c0
__s^df.%-__oh - oh i see .__c1
__s^na__yeah .__c1
__s.%--__if you had ninety percent uh - correct and five percent ==__c0
__b__five over ninety doesn't look like it's a big difference .__c0
__s^ba__but five over ten is - is big .__c0
__s^na__uhhuh .__c1
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c5
__b__so just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and getting sense of what was important .__c0
__s^df__i see i see .__c1
__b__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__that makes sense .__c1
__%-__um ==__c0
__s^ba__huh .__c5
__s__um ==__c0
__s__well anyway ==__c5
__b__uh ==__c5
__s__so ==__c5
__s^cs__yeah | so it hurts a little bit on the well match .__c5
__b__and ==__c5
__%--__yeah .__c5
__s__what's a little bit ?__c0
__s^cc__like ==__c0
__b__like it's difficult to say .__c5
__s^df.%--__because again ==__c5
__s^ba__um - | i'm not sure i have the ==__c5
__s^na__um ==__c5
__s^aa__hey morgan .__c1
__s^cs__do you remember that signif program that we used to use for testing signi- ?==__c1
__b__is that still valid ?__c1
__b__i - i've been using that .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c0
__s^e__yeah | it was actually updated .__c0
__b__okay .__c1
__b__uh - jeff updated it some years ago .__c0
__s^cc.%--__oh it was ?__c1
__s^cc__oh i shoul- ==__c1
__s^ft.%__and - and uh - cleaned it up made some things better in it .__c0
__fg__okay .__c1
__fh|qy^bu^rt^t^tc__so ==__c0
__s^aa|s.%-__i should find that new one .__c1
__qy^j^rt__i just use my old one from ninety two or whatever .__c1
__s^ar__yeah i'm sure it's not that different .__c0
__s^e__but - but he - he uh - he was a little more rigorous as i recall .__c0
__s^bd__okay .__c1
__fh|s__right .__c5
__s__so it's around like point five .__c5
__s__no point six uh - percent absolute on italian .__c5
__s__worse .__c0
__s^df__worse yep .__c5
__s^ba__out of what ?__c0
__s^df__i mean s- ==__c0
__fh|s^cc__uh - well we start from ninety four point sixty four .__c5
__s^df__and we go to ninety four point o four .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__fh__so that's six - six point th- ==__c0
__s__uh ==__c5
__fh__ninety three point six four .__c1
__s^cc__right ?__c1
__s.%--__is the baseline .__c1
__s__oh no | i've ninety four .__c5
__s__oh the baseline you mean .__c5
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__well i don't - i'm not talking about the baseline here .__c5
__fh__oh oh .__c1
__s.%--__i ==__c5
__s__i'm sorry .__c1
__fh__uh ==__c5
__fh|qy^cs__my baseline is the submitted system .__c5
__s^ba__uh okay uh uh .__c1
__s^aap__huh .__c5
__s__sorry .__c1
__s^bd__yeah .__c0
__s__uh ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__fh|s^cs__for finnish we start to ninety three point eight four .__c5
__fh|%-__and we go to ninety three point seventy four .__c5
__s^co__and for spanish we are - we were at ninety five point o five .__c5
__b__and we go to ninety-three-s- - point sixty one .__c5
__fh|s__okay | so we are getting hurt somewhat .__c0
__s.%--__so ==__c5
__s^aa__and is that ?==__c0
__s__wh- - what ?==__c0
__fh__do you know what piece ?==__c0
__s__you've done several changes here .__c0
__fg|s^cs:s__uh ==__c0
__b__do you know what pie- ?==__c0
__b__yeah .__c5
__s^e__i guess - i guess it's - it's the filter .__c5
__b__because - nnn - well uh - we don't have complete result .__c5
__fh__but the filter - so the filter with the shorter delay hurts on italian well matched .__c5
__s^aa|%-__which ==__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__and ==__c5
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__fh|s^e__and the other things like um - downsampling upsampling don't seem to hurt .__c5
__s__and the new online normalization neither .__c5
__fg__i'm ==__c1
__s^aap.%-__so ==__c5
__fg__i'm really confused about something .__c1
__s^arp__if we saw that making a small change like you know a tenth to the self loop had a huge effect can we really make any conclusions about differences in this stuff ?__c1
__s^e__uhhuh .__c5
__s^2__yeah | that's th- ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__fh__i mean especially when they're this small .__c1
__qh__i mean ==__c1
__s__i think we can be completely fooled by this thing .__c5
__b__but ==__c5
__%-__i don't know .__c5
__s__well - | yeah .__c0
__qy^d^f^g^rt__so there is first this thing .__c5
__s^na__and then the ==__c5
__s^df__yeah | i computed the um - like the confidence level on the different test sets .__c5
__qh^rt__and for the well matched they are around um - point six uh - percent .__c5
__s:qy__for the mismatched they are around like let's say one point five percent .__c5
__fh__and for the well m- - uh - h m they are also around one point five .__c5
__s:s^co__but - okay so you - these - these degradations you were talking about were on the well matched case .__c0
__b__so ==__c5
__s.%--__yeah .__c5
__s^cs.%-__uh - do the - does the new filter make things uh - better or worse for the other cases ?__c0
__s^aa^rt__but ==__c5
__s^aa__uh - about the same .__c5
__s^aa^r__it doesn't hurt .__c5
__b__yeah .__c5
__s^cs__doesn't hurt but doesn't get a little better or something .__c0
__s^df__no .__c5
__s^e__no .__c0
__s.%-__okay | so um - i guess the argument one might make is that yeah if you looked at one of these cases and you jiggle something and it changes then uh - you're not quite sure what to make of it .__c0
__s__but when you look across a bunch of these and there's some - some pattern ==__c0
__s__um ==__c0
__s__i mean so uh - h- - here's all the - if - if in all these different cases it never gets better and there's significant number of cases where it gets worse then you're probably hurting things i would say .__c0
__s^no__so um - i mean at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with - with a different test set that you're not jiggling things with .__c0
__fh__so i guess the question is if you can do better than this ?__c0
__s^ng.%-__if you can - if we can approximate the old numbers while still keeping the latency down .__c0
__%-__huh .__c5
__s^df__yeah .__c5
__s.%-__uh - so ==__c0
__s.%--__um - | what i was asking though is uh are - what's - what's the level of communication with uh - the o g i gang now about this ?__c0
__s.%--__and ==__c0
__s^ng.%--__well we are exchanging mail as soon as we - we have significant results .__c5
__s^e__yeah .__c0
__fg__um ==__c5
__s^bd__yeah .__c5
__b__for the moment they are working on integrating the um - spectral subtraction apparently from ericsson .__c5
__s^no__uhhuh .__c0
__s^cs__um ==__c5
__s^e__yeah .__c5
__s^bd:s__and so ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__we are working on our side on other things like uh - also trying a sup- - spectral subtraction .__c5
__s^j.%--__but of - of our own i mean another spectral subtraction .__c5
__s^j^no__uhhuh .__c0
__s^cs.%-__um ==__c5
__s^2^j__yeah .__c5
__fg|s^cs__so i think it's - it's okay .__c5
__s^cs__it's going ==__c5
__s^df__is there any further discussion about this - this idea of - of having some sort of source code control ?__c0
__%-__yeah .__c5
__%-__well for the moment they're ==__c5
__qo^cs__uh everybody's quite ==__c5
__s^fe^nd__um ==__c5
__h__there is this eurospeech deadline .__c5
__s^na__so ==__c5
__s^e__i see .__c0
__s^ng.%-__um - and ==__c5
__s^2__yeah .__c5
__s^bd__but yeah .__c5
__s^df__as soon as we have something that's significant and that's better than - than what was submitted .__c5
__%-__we will fix - fix the system .__c5
__b__and ==__c5
__%-__but we've not discussed it - it - it - this yet .__c5
__%-__yeah .__c5
__s^ng__yeah .__c0
__s^fe__sounds like a great idea .__c0
__s^e:s__but - but i think that - that um - he's saying people are sort of scrambling for a eurospeech deadline .__c0
__qh^d^rt__huh .__c5
__s^aa__but that'll be uh - uh - done in a week .__c0
__s.%-__so maybe after this next one .__c0
__b__yeah .__c5
__b__wow !__c1
__b__already a week !__c1
__s__man !__c1
__b__yeah .__c0
__b__you're right .__c1
__%--__that's amazing .__c1
__fg|s^df__yeah .__c0
__s^co__anybo- - anybody in the - in this group do- - doing anything for eurospeech ?__c0
__s^aa__s- ==__c5
__s^bk|s^df:s__or is that what - is that ?==__c0
__b__yeah | we are - we are trying to - to do something with the meeting recorder digits .__c5
__s^2__right .__c0
__b__and ==__c5
__fh__but yeah .__c5
__s^co^t^tc__yeah .__c5
__qo^t^tc__and the good thing is that there is this first deadline .__c5
__fh|s^rt__yeah .__c0
__fh|s^e__and well some people from o g i are working on a paper for this .__c5
__b^rt__but there is also the um - special session about th- - aurora .__c5
__s^rt__which is - uh - which has an extended deadline .__c5
__s.%--__so ==__c5
__b__the deadline is in may .__c5
__s__for uh - oh for eurospeech ?__c0
__s^df__for th- ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__s^df__so f- - only for the experiments on aurora .__c5
__s__oh !__c0
__s__so it - it's good .__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__s^e__oh a special dispensation .__c0
__fh|s__that's great .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s__where is eurospeech this year ?__c1
__s^ba__it's in denmark .__c5
__s^bu__aalborg .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__aalborg ==__c0
__s^e.%-__uh ==__c0
__s^arp^rt__oh .__c1
__s^am__so the deadline ==__c0
__fg|s__when's the deadline ?__c0
__b__huh ?__c5
__s^no__when's the deadline ?__c0
__h__i think it's the thirteenth of may .__c5
__s^nd__that's great .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__it's great .__c0
__s^na__so we should definitely get something in for that .__c0
__s^df__yeah .__c5
__b__but on meeting digits maybe there's ==__c0
__fg|qy^bu^rt__maybe .__c0
__s^e__yeah .__c5
__b__so it would be for the first deadline .__c5
__s^arp^rt|%-__maybe .__c0
__%-__yeah .__c0
__qy^d^rt__nnn .__c5
__s^am__yeah | so i mean i - i think that you could certainly start looking at - at the issue .__c0
__s__uh - | but - but uh - i think it's probably on s- - from what stephane is saying it's - it's unlikely to get sort of active participation from the two sides until after they've ==__c0
__s^no__well i could at least ==__c1
__s.%-__well i'm going to be out next week .__c1
__qy^rt__but i could try to look into like this uh - c v s over the web .__c1
__b__that seems to be a very popular way of people distributing changes and - over you know multiple sites and things .__c1
__fh__uhhuh .__c0
__s.%--__so maybe if i can figure out how do that easily and then pass the information on to everybody so that it's you know as easy to do as possible .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__and - and people don't - it won't interfere with their regular work .__c1
__s^aa__then maybe that would be good .__c1
__s^ng__and i think we could use it for other things around here too .__c1
__b__so ==__c1
__s^no.%-__good .__c0
__%-__that's cool .__c2
__s^2__and if you're interested in using c v s i've set it up here .__c2
__b__so ==__c2
__s__oh great .__c1
__s__okay .__c1
__%-__um - | j- ==__c2
__s^e__i used it a long time ago .__c1
__b__but it's been a while .__c1
__s__so maybe i can ask you some questions .__c1
__s^aa__oh .__c2
__s^aa__so i'll be away tomorrow and monday but i'll be back on tuesday or wednesday .__c2
__qh^cs.%-__okay .__c1
__s^2__yeah .__c0
__b__dave the other thing actually is - is this business about this wave form .__c0
__s^2^r__maybe you and i can talk a little bit at some point about coming up with a better uh - demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page .__c0
__s^bd__because ==__c0
__b__uh - the uh - um ==__c0
__b__i mean actually the - the ==__c0
__s.%--__uh ==__c0
__b__it made a good - good audio demonstration because when we could play that clip the - the - the really obvious difference is that you can hear two voices and - in the second one and only hear ==__c0
__qy^bu^rt__maybe we could just like talk into a cup .__c1
__s^e__yeah .__c0
__s^aa__some good reverb .__c1
__s__no | i mean it sound - it sounds pretty reverberant .__c0
__s^e:qy__but i mean you can't - when you play it back in a room with a - you know a big room nobody can hear that difference really .__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c2
__s^e__they hear that it's lower amplitude and they hear there's a second voice .__c0
__s^r.%--__um - but uh ==__c0
__s__that - actually that makes for a perfectly good demo .__c0
__s__because that's a real obvious thing that you hear two voices .__c0
__s^e__but not of reverberation .__c1
__fh|s^cs__yeah .__c0
__s^e__a boom .__c2
__s^bs__well that - that - that's okay .__c0
__b__but for the - the visual just you know i'd like to have uh - uh - you know the spectrogram again .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s__because you're - you're - you're visual uh - abilities as a human being are so good you can pick out ==__c0
__s__you know you - you look at the good one you look at the cru- - the screwed up one and - and you can see the features in it without trying to .__c0
__s^e__i noticed that in the pictures .__c1
__fh__@reject@ yeah .__c0
__s^co__i thought hey you know th- - i ==__c1
__fh__my initial thought was this is not too bad .__c1
__s^ba^cs__right .__c0
__s^df__but you have to - you know if you look at it closely you see well here's a place where this one has a big formant .__c0
__fh__uh - uh - | formant - maj- - major formants here are - are moving quite a bit .__c0
__s__and then you look in the other one and they look practically flat .__c0
__s^df__uhhuh .__c1
__b__so i mean you could - that's why i was thinking in a section like that you could take a look - look at just that part of the spectrogram and you could say oh yeah .__c0
__s__this - this really distorted it quite a bit .__c0
__b__yeah .__c1
__s^ba__the main thing that struck me in looking at those two spectrograms was the difference in the high frequencies .__c1
__s^df__it looked like for the one that was farther away you know it really - everything was attenuated .__c1
__%--__and ==__c1
__b__right .__c0
__s__i mean that was the main visual thing that i noticed .__c1
__%--__right .__c0
__s__but it's - it's ==__c0
__s^ba__uh ==__c0
__s^cs__so ==__c0
__s:s__yeah .__c0
__s__so there are - clearly are spectral effects .__c0
__s^rt__since you're getting all this indirect energy then a lot of it does have - have uh - reduced high frequencies .__c0
__s__but um - the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed and - and uh - we want to show that in some obvious way .__c0
__s^df__the reason i put the wave forms in there was because uh - they - they do look quite different .__c0
__%-__uh - a nd so i thought oh this is good .__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__but i - i just ==__c0
__h|s^ba__uh ==__c0
__s^rt__after - after uh - they were put in there i didn't really look at them anymore .__c0
__s__because i just - they were different .__c0
__b__so i want something that has a - is a more interesting explanation for why they're different .__c0
__b__um ==__c0
__s__oh .__c2
__s^e.%--__so maybe we can just substitute one of these wave forms .__c2
__b__and um - then do some kind of zoom in on the spectrogram on an interesting area .__c2
__s__something like that .__c0
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s^df__the other thing that we had in there that i didn't like was that um - the most obvious characteristic of the difference uh - when you listen to it is that there's a second voice .__c0
__s__and the - the - the - the - the uh - cuts that we have there actually don't correspond to the full wave form .__c0
__qy^rt__it's just the first ==__c0
__s^am|s__i think there was something where he was having some trouble getting so much in .__c0
__s__or ==__c0
__s^bk__i - i forget the reason behind it .__c0
__s^ba__but it - it's um - it's the first six seconds or something of it .__c0
__s__and it's in the seventh or eighth second or something where @reject@ the second voice comes in .__c0
__fh__so we - we would like to actually see the voice coming in too i think .__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c2
__s^tc|s^ba__since that's the most obvious thing when you listen to it .__c0
__s__so ==__c0
__s^bk__um - @reject@ ==__c0
__s^e__uh - | yeah .__c5
__%-__yeah .__c5
__s^aa__i brought some - i don't know if - some figures here .__c5
__b__well i start - we started to work on spectral subtraction .__c5
__qy.%--__and um - the preliminary results were very bad .__c5
__s^bk|s__so the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this the wall uh - process which contains l d a online normalization .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__qy^rt__and it hurts uh - a lot .__c5
__%-__uhhuh .__c0
__s^no__and so we started to look at - at um - things like this .__c5
__s.%--__which is ==__c5
__s.%--__well it's ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__s^bk__so you have the c zero parameters for one uh - italian utterance .__c5
__qy^br^rt__you can @reject@ .__c3
__s__and i plotted this for two channels .__c5
__s.%--__channel zero is the close mic- - microphone .__c5
__b__and channel one is the distant microphone .__c5
__s.%--__and it's perfectly synchronized .__c5
__s.%--__so ==__c5
__b__and the sentence contain only one word which is due .__c5
__s__and it can't clearly be seen .__c5
__s.%-__where - where is it ?__c5
__s^bk|%-__where is the word ?__c5
__s^2__uhhuh .__c0
__s^m^na__this is - this is ==__c1
__b__huh .__c4
__s^aa__oh a plot of c zero .__c1
__s.%--__so ==__c5
__fh__the energy .__c1
__s__this is a plot of c zero uh - when we don't use spectral subtraction .__c5
__s__and when there is no online normalization .__c5
__b__so ==__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__s__there is just some filtering with the l d a .__c5
__s^bk__and - and some downsampling upsampling .__c5
__s^bu__c zero is the close talking ?__c1
__s__so ==__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__uh - the close channel ?__c1
__s__yeah yeah .__c5
__b__and s- - channel one is the ?==__c1
__s^am__yeah .__c5
__s^am__so c zero is very clean actually .__c5
__b__yeah .__c1
__s^e__uh - then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure .__c5
__s.%--__though it is not .__c5
__s__which is good .__c5
__s^cs__well the noise part is around zero .__c5
__s^cs__and - and then the third figure is what happens when we apply mean normalization and variance normalization .__c5
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c0
__s__so ==__c5
__fh__what we can clearly see is that on the speech portion the two channel come - becomes very close .__c5
__fg|s__but also what happens on the noisy portion is that the variance of the noise is ==__c5
__qy^d^f^g__uhhuh .__c0
__s^bk__this is still being a plot of c zero ?__c1
__s.%--__yeah | this is still c zero .__c5
__s^bk__okay .__c1
__fh__can i ask um - what does variance normalization do ?__c1
__s__w- - what is the effect of that ?__c1
__b__normalizes the variance .__c0
__s__so it - it ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__it normalized th- - the standard deviation .__c5
__s__i mean ==__c1
__s__so it ==__c5
__s__y- - yeah .__c1
__b__you - you get an estimate of the standard deviation .__c5
__s__no | i understand that .__c1
__b__but i mean ==__c1
__fh__that's ==__c5
__qy^d^rt__um ==__c5
__b.%__no .__c1
__s^aa__no i understand what it is .__c1
__s^bk__but i mean what does it - what's - what is ?==__c1
__b__yeah but ==__c5
__fg|s__uh ==__c1
__s^aa|%-__what's the rationale ?__c0
__%-__we- ==__c1
__fg|s__yeah .yeah .__c1
__b__why - why do it ?__c1
__s^df__uh ==__c5
__s.%-__well i mean because everything uh - if you have a system based on gaussians everything is based on means and variances .__c0
__s^bk|s^df__yeah .__c1
__%-__so if there's an overall reason ==__c0
__qy^d^f^g__you know it's like uh - if you were doing uh - image processing .__c0
__s.%-__and in some of the pictures you were looking at uh - there was a lot of light .__c0
__s^df^ng__uh- - and - and in some there was low light .__c0
__s^m^t1.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__s^ng__you know you would want to adjust for that in order to compare things .__c0
__s^aa|s^rt__uhhuh .__c1
__s__and the variance is just sort of like the next moment .__c0
__s.%--__you know .__c0
__s.%--__so uh - what if um - one set of pictures was taken uh - so that throughout the course it was - went through daylight and night uh - um - um - ten times ?__c0
__fh__another time it went thr- ==__c0
__s.%--__i mean i- - is you know how - how much - how much vari- ==__c0
__s__oh okay .__c1
__s__or no .__c0
__s^e__i guess a better example would be how much of the light was coming in from outside ?__c0
__s.%-__rather than artificial light .__c0
__qy^2^bu^d^rt__so if it was a lot - if more was coming from outside then there'd be the bigger effect of the - of the - of the change in the ==__c0
__s^aa__so every mean - every - all - all of the - the parameters that you have especially the variances are going to be affected by the overall variance .__c0
__s^bk|s__oh okay .__c1
__%-__uhhuh .__c1
__s^aa__and so in principle you - if you remove that source then you know you can ==__c0
__s__i see okay .__c1
__%--__so would - the major effect is - that you're going to get is by normalizing the means .__c1
__s__but it may help ==__c1
__s__that's the first order but - thing .__c0
__b__first order effects .__c1
__s^e__and it may help to do the variance .__c1
__s^df__but then the second order is - is the variances .__c0
__fg|qw.%-__okay .__c1
__s^df__okay .__c1
__b__because again if you - if you're trying to distinguish between e and b ==__c0
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__s__if it just so happens that the e s were a more - you know were recorded when - when the energy was - was - was larger or something ==__c0
__s__huh huh .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__s^am__uhhuh .__c1
__s__or the variation in it was larger uh - than with the b s then this will be - give you some - some bias .__c0
__b__so the - it's removing these sources of variability in the data that have nothing to do with the linguistic component .__c0
__s__okay .__c1
__b__huh .__c5
__s^am^bd^cs__gotcha okay .__c1
__s^bd^df^no__sorry to interrupt .__c1
__s__yep .__c5
__s__but the - the uh - but let me as- - ask - ask you something .__c0
__s.%--__and it - and this ==__c5
__qw^t1__i- - is - if - if you have a good voice activity detector isn't - isn't it going to pull that out ?__c0
__s^bu__yeah .sure .__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__if they are good .__c5
__s^aa|s__yeah .__c5
__s^bk__well what it - it shows is that yeah perhaps a good voice activity detector is - is good before online normalization .__c5
__s__and that's what uh - we've already observed .__c5
__s^df__but uh ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__qy.%-__voice activity detection is not an easy thing neither .__c5
__s^na__but after you do this after you do the variance normalization ==__c1
__s^bk|s__uhhuh .__c5
__s^e__i mean ==__c1
__s.%--__i don't know it seems like this would be a lot easier than this signal to work with .__c1
__%--__yeah .__c5
__s__so | what i notice is that while i prefer to look at the second figure than at the third one .__c5
__s__well because you clearly see where speech is .__c5
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__b__yeah .__c0
__s__but the problem is that on the speech portion channel zero and channel one are more different .than when you use variance normalization where channel zero and channel one become closer .__c5
__s__right .__c0
__b__but for the purposes of finding the speech ==__c1
__s__and ==__c5
__s^rt__yeah | but here ==__c5
__s:s__yeah .__c5
__s:qw__you're more interested in the difference between the speech and the non speech ?__c1
__b__yeah .__c5
__b__right ?__c1
__s__so i think ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__s^fe__for i th- - i think that it - perhaps it shows that uh - the parameters that the voice activity detector should use - uh - have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition .__c5
__s__yeah | so basically you want to reduce this effect .__c0
__b__well y- ==__c5
__s.%-__so you can do that by doing the voi- - voice activity detection .__c0
__qy^d^rt__you also could do it by spect- - uh - spectral subtraction before the variance normalization .__c0
__s^ar|s__right ?__c0
__qrr.%-__yeah | but it's not clear .__c5
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__s^ba__so uh ==__c0
__s__we- ==__c5
__s__so ==__c5
__s__well it's just to ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__the - the number that at- - that are here are recognition experiments on italian h m and m m with these two kinds of parameters .__c5
__s__and well it's better with variance normalization .__c5
__s__yeah .__c0
__b__yeah .__c0
__s^e__so it does get better even though it looks ugly .__c0
__s__uh ==__c5
__s__okay .__c0
__s__but does this have the voice activity detection in it ?__c0
__s:s__yeah .__c5
__s__okay .__c0
__s__um ==__c5
__s__okay .__c4
__s__so ==__c0
__s__where's th- ?==__c1
__s__but the fact is that the voice activity detector doesn't work on channel one .__c5
__b__so ==__c5
__fh__yeah .__c5
__s.%-__uhhuh .__c0
__s__where - at what stage is the voice activity detector applied ?__c1
__s^m^na__is it applied here or a- - after the variance normalization ?__c1
__s__huh ?__c5
__s__spectral subtraction i guess .__c0
__s__it's applied before variance normalization .__c5
__qw__or ?==__c1
__s.%-__so it's a good thing .__c5
__qy^rt__because i guess voice activity detection on this should - could be worse .__c5
__s^rt__oh .__c1
__%--__yeah .__c1
__s^aa|s__is it applied all the way back here ?__c1
__s^bd__it's applied the ==__c5
__b__um - | on ==__c5
__b__yeah .__c5
__s^bk__something like this .__c5
__fh__yeah .__c5
__s__maybe that's why it doesn't work for channel one .__c1
__s__perhaps yeah .__c5
__b__can i ?==__c0
__s__so we could perhaps do just mean normalization before v a d .__c5
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__fh__uhhuh .__c0
__s__can i ask a i mean a sort of top level question ?__c0
__b__which is um - if - if most of what the o g i folk are working with is trying to integrate this other - other uh - spectral subtraction why are we worrying about it ?__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__about ?__c5
__s__spectral subtraction ?__c5
__s__yeah .__c0
__b__it's just uh - well it's another ==__c5
__s__they are trying to u- - to use the um - the ericsson .__c5
__s^aap__and we're trying to use something - something else .__c5
__s^df__and ==__c5
__%-__yeah | and also to understand what happens because ==__c5
__%--__okay .__c0
__s^bk__uh - fff ==__c5
__s__well when we do spectral subtraction actually i think that this is the - the two last figures .__c5
__s^bd^df__yeah .__c0
__s__um - | it seems that after spectral subtraction speech is more emerging now uh - than - than before .__c5
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__s^bd__speech is more what ?__c1
__s^bd__well the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of the n- - spectral subtrac- - subtracted noise portion is - is larger .__c5
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c0
__s^f__well if you compare the first figure to this one ==__c5
__fh__actually the scale is not the same .__c5
__s^na|s^aa__but if you look at the - the numbers um - you clearly see that the difference between the c zero of the speech and c zero of the noise portion is larger .__c5
__s^bk__uh - but what happens is that after spectral subtraction you also increase the variance of this - of c zero .__c5
__s^e|s^f__and so if you apply variance normalization on this it completely sc- - screw everything .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__fg|qy.%--__well ==__c5
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__qy^rt__um - uh - yeah .__c5
__s^na|s^aa__so yeah .__c5
__qy^d^f^g^rt__and what they did at o g i is just uh they - don't use online normalization for the moment on spectral subtraction .__c5
__%--__and i think ==__c5
__fh__yeah .__c5
__s__i think as soon as they will try online normalization there will be a problem .__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__so yeah we're working on the same thing but i think ==__c5
__s^df__uh ==__c5
__s^aa__with different - different system .__c5
__s__and ==__c5
__fh__right .__c0
__s__i mean i- - the ==__c0
__s^e__intellectually it's interesting to work on things th- - uh - one way or the other .__c0
__s^e__uhhuh .__c5
__s^e__but i'm - i'm just wondering if um - on the list of things that there are to do ==__c0
__b__if there are things that we won't do because we've got two groups doing the same thing .__c0
__s^e__uhhuh .__c5
__s__um ==__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__that's ==__c0
__b__um ==__c0
__s.%--__just - just asking .__c0
__s^bk__uh - i mean it's ==__c0
__fg|s.%--__yeah | well ==__c5
__s__uh ==__c5
__s__there also could be - i mean i can maybe see a reason f- - for both working on it too .__c1
__b__if um - you know if - if - if you work on something else and - and you're waiting for them to give you spectral subtraction ==__c1
__b__i mean it's hard to know whether the effects that you get from the other experiments you do will carry over once you then bring in their spectral subtraction module .__c1
__s.%-__so it's - it's almost like everything's held up waiting for this one thing .__c1
__s__i don't know if that's true or not .__c1
__qy^bu^d__but i could see how ==__c1
__s^aa|s^na__huh .__c5
__%-__maybe that's what you were thinking .__c1
__qy^bu^d^e__i don't know i don't know .__c0
__s^m^na__i mean we still evidently have a latency reduction plan which - which isn't quite what you'd like it to be .__c0
__s^bk__that - that seems like one prominent thing .__c0
__s^e__and then uh - weren't issues of - of having a - a second stream or something ?__c0
__qy^bu^rt__that was ==__c0
__qrr.%--__was it ==__c0
__s^na__there was this business that you know we - we could use up the full forty eight hundred bits .__c0
__qy^d^f^g^rt__and ==__c0
__s^bk__yeah | but i think they'r- ==__c5
__s.%--__i think we want to work on this .__c5
__b__they also want to work on this .__c5
__b__so ==__c5
__s__uh yeah .__c5
__b__we - we will try m s g .__c5
__qy.%--__but um ==__c5
__s^co__yeah .__c5
__s^df__and they are t- ==__c5
__s^bd^df__i think they want to work on the second stream also .__c5
__s^no__but more with some kind of multi band .__c5
__b__or well what they call trap or generalized trap .__c5
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c0
__s__um - so ==__c5
__b__okay .__c0
__s__do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be ?__c0
__s^rt__it's uh - in june .__c5
__b__the next uh ==__c0
__s__in june .__c0
__s^df__okay .__c0
__b__yeah .__c5
__s__yeah .__c0
__s^2__um - | yeah the other thing is that you saw that - that mail about uh - the v a d - v a d's performing quite differently .__c0
__b__that - that ==__c0
__s^aa__uh ==__c0
__fg|s^cs__so um ==__c0
__s__this - there was this experiment of uh - what if we just take the baseline ?__c0
__s__huh .__c5
__s^e__set uh - of features .__c0
__b__just mel cepstra .__c0
__b__and you inc- - incorporate the different v a d's .__c0
__%-__and it looks like the - the french v a d is actually uh - better - significantly better .__c0
__s^am__improves the baseline ?__c1
__%-__yeah .__c0
__s^ba^df__yeah .__c0
__s^bk__yeah but i don't know which v a d they use .__c5
__fh__uh - | if the use the small v a d ==__c5
__s__i th- - i think it's on ==__c5
__s^bk__i think it's easy to do better .__c5
__s.%--__because it doesn't work at all .__c5
__fh__so ==__c5
__b__i - i don't know which - which one .__c5
__s__it's pratibha that - that did this experiment .__c5
__%-__yeah .__c3
__s__um - we should ask which v a d she used .__c5
__s__i don't @reject@ .__c3
__%-__he - actually i think that he say with the good v a d of - from ogi .__c3
__fg|s__and with the alcatel v a d .__c3
__%-__and the experiment was sometime better sometime worse .__c3
__qh__yeah | but i - it's uh - i think you were talking about the other mail that used v a d on the reference features .__c5
__b__yes .__c0
__%-__yeah .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__i don't remember .__c3
__%-__and on that one uh - the french one is - was better .__c0
__s^aa__it was just better .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__b__i mean it was enough better that - that it would uh - account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance actually .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s.%--__so uh ==__c0
__s^df__so if they have a better one we should use it .__c0
__s__i mean ==__c0
__s^bk__you know ?__c0
__s__it's ==__c0
__s^e__you can't work on everything .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__s__uh - uh - yeah .__c0
__%--__yeah | so we should find out if it's really better .__c5
__b__i mean if it ==__c5
__b__the - compared to the small or the big network .__c5
__fh|s.%--__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bu__yeah .__c0
__qy^g^rt__and perhaps we can easily improve if - if we put like mean normalization before the - before the v a d .__c5
__s^e__because - as - as you've mentioned ==__c5
__s^ar|s__yeah .__c0
__s^bk^m|s^bk__huh .__c5
__s^aa__h- - hynek will be back in town uh - the week after next .__c0
__b__back - back in the country .__c0
__s.%-__so ==__c0
__s.%-__and start - start organizing uh - more visits and connections and so forth .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__b__and ==__c0
__b__uh ==__c0
__b__working towards june .__c0
__fg|s^cs__yeah .__c5
__fh__uhhuh .__c5
__s^df.%--__also is stephane was thinking that maybe it was useful to f- - to think about uh - voiced unvoiced ==__c3
__s__to work uh - here in voiced unvoiced detection .__c3
__b__yeah .__c5
__s__and we are looking in the uh - signal .__c3
__fg|s__yeah .__c5
__s^df__yeah | my feeling is that um - actually when we look at all the proposals ev- - everybody is still using some kind of spectral envelope .__c5
__s^df^e.%-__and um - it's ==__c5
__s^arp^j__right .__c0
__fg__no use of pitch uh - basically .__c0
__%-__yeah .__c0
__s^bu__yeah | well not pitch .__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__but to look at the um - fine - at the - at the high re- - high resolution spectrum .__c5
__s^aa__yeah .__c0
__s^bd__so we don't necessarily want to find the - the pitch of the - of the sound .__c5
__s.%-__well it ==__c0
__s^nd__but ==__c5
__s^bk|s.%-__uh ==__c5
__s^e.%-__because i have a feeling that when we look - when we look at the - just at the envelope there is no way you can tell if it's voiced and unvoiced .__c5
__s^aa__if there is some ==__c5
__s.%-__it's - it's easy in clean speech because voiced sound are more low frequency .__c5
__fg|%-__and ==__c5
__%-__so there would be more ==__c5
__s^nd__yeah .__c0
__s^e__uh - there is the first formant which is the larger .__c5
__s^aa|s^df.%-__and then voiced sound are more high frequencies .__c5
__s__because it's frication .__c5
__s__and ==__c5
__s^df__right .__c0
__s__but ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__when you have noise there is no ==__c5
__s.%--__um - if - if you have a low frequency noise it could be taken for - for voiced speech .__c5
__fh__and ==__c5
__s__yeah | you can make these mistakes .__c0
__s__so ==__c5
__s^df__but - but ==__c0
__s^df^e__isn't there some other ?==__c1
__s__s- ==__c5
__s^cs__uh d- ==__c1
__%-__so i think that it - it would be good ==__c5
__b__yeah yeah .__c5
__s^aa__well go - go on .__c5
__b__uh i was just going to say isn't there - aren't - aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity or speech-nonspeech rather um - by looking at um - you know uh - i guess harmonics ?==__c1
__s^df__or looking across time ?==__c1
__fg|s__well i think he was talking about the voiced unvoiced though .__c0
__%-__huh .__c5
__b__right ?__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__so not the speech-nonspeech .__c0
__b__well even with e- ==__c1
__s.%-__uh - w- - uh ==__c1
__s^aa|s^am__yeah .__c0
__b__you know uh - even with the voiced non- - voiced unvoiced .__c1
__s__huh .__c5
__s__um ==__c1
__s__i thought that you or somebody was talking about ==__c1
__s__well ==__c0
__s__so ==__c5
__s^e__uh - yeah | b- - we should let him finish what he w- - he was going to say .__c0
__b__okay .__c1
__s__and ==__c0
__s^bk|s__so go ahead .__c1
__fg|%-__um - yeah so yeah | i think if we try to develop a second stream ==__c5
__b__well there would be one stream that is the envelope and the second it could be interesting to have .__c5
__b__that's - something that's more related to the fine structure of the spectrum .__c5
__qy^rt__and ==__c5
__%-__yeah | so i don't know .__c5
__b__we were thinking about like using ideas from - from larry saul .__c5
__qrr.%-__have a good voice detector ==__c5
__s^ar|s__have a good ==__c5
__s^bk|s^cs__well | voiced speech detector that's working on - on the f f t .__c5
__b__and uh ==__c5
__b__larry saul could be an idea .__c5
__fg|s^bd__u- ==__c0
__b__we were are thinking about just kind of uh - taking the spectrum .__c5
__s^df__and computing the variance of - of the high resolution spectrum and things like this .__c5
__s__so u- - s- - u- ==__c0
__s^bk|qy^rt__okay .__c0
__s^aa__so - so many tell you something about that .__c0
__s^bk__uh - we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on um - making use of voicing information uh - to help in reducing the noise .__c0
__s__yeah .__c5
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c5
__fg|s__so what he was doing is basically y- - you - you do estimate the pitch .__c0
__b__and ==__c0
__qy^rt__um ==__c0
__s__you - from that you - you estimate ==__c0
__s^br__or you estimate fine harmonic structure .__c0
__qy^rt__whichev- ==__c0
__s^aa__ei- - either way .__c0
__s^bk__it's more or less the same .__c0
__s^bd__but uh - the thing is that um - you then can get rid of things that are not ==__c0
__s^df__i- - if there is strong harmonic structure you can throw away stuff that's - that's non harmonic .__c0
__s^df__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk|%-__uhhuh .__c5
__s^no__and that - that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise .__c0
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__b__so um - | that's something that is sort of finer .__c0
__s^e__brings in a little more information than just spectral subtraction .__c0
__b__um ==__c0
__s^no__uhhuh .__c5
__qy.%--__and he had some - i mean he did that sort of in combination with rasta .__c0
__qy^bu^d.%-__it was kind of like rasta was taking care of convolutional stuff .__c0
__s^ar|s^no__huh .__c5
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk__and he was ==__c0
__fg|s^tc__and - and got some - some decent results doing that .__c0
__s__so that - that's another - another way .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__fh__but yeah there's - there's ==__c0
__s^tc__huh .__c5
__s^df__right .__c0
__s__there's all these cues .__c0
__b__we've ==__c0
__s^bk__but ==__c5
__qy^rt__actually back when chuck was here we did some voiced unvoiced uh - classification using a bunch of these .__c0
__%-__and - and ==__c0
__qrr__uh ==__c0
__h__works okay .__c0
__s^cs__obviously it's not perfect .__c0
__s^bd^no__but ==__c0
__qy.%-__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk__um ==__c0
__qy^rt__but the thing is that you can't ==__c0
__s^cs__given the constraints of this task we can't in a very nice way feed forward to the recognizer the information .__c0
__s^df.x__the probabilistic information that you might get about whether it's voiced or unvoiced ==__c0
__s^nd__uhhuh .__c5
__s^cs__where w- - we can't you know affect the - the uh - distributions or anything .__c0
__s^f__but we - what we ==__c0
__s^bk^rt__uh ==__c0
__%--__i guess we could ==__c0
__qr__yeah .__c0
__qy^d^rt__didn't the head dude send around that message ?__c1
__s^cs^ng__yeah i think you sent us all a copy of the message .__c1
__s^bd^no__where he was saying that ==__c1
__s^cs^ng__i- - i'm not sure exactly what the gist of what he was saying .__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__but something having to do with the voice activity detector .__c1
__s^ba^j__and that it will - that people shouldn't put their own in or something .__c1
__b__it was going to be a ==__c1
__s^bu__that - but ==__c0
__%-__okay .__c0
__qy^g^rt__so that's voice activity detector as opposed to voicing detector .__c0
__s^fa|s__they didn't .__c5
__s^df^e__so we're talking about something a little different .__c0
__s^bk__huh .__c5
__s^e__oh | i'm sorry .__c1
__s^ba__huh .__c5
__s^bk__i - i missed that .__c1
__qh^cs.%-__right ?__c0
__qo^rt__i guess what you could do maybe ==__c0
__s^ar__this would be w- - useful if - if you have - if you view the second stream ==__c0
__qy^rt__yeah | before you - before you do k l t's and so forth ==__c0
__b.%__if you do view it as probabilities ==__c0
__s^bk__and if it's an independent ==__c0
__s__so if it's - if it's uh - not so much envelope based by fine structure based ==__c0
____uh - looking at harmonicity or something like that ==__c0
____um - | if you get a probability from that information .__c0
____and then multiply it by - you know multiply by all the voiced outputs and all the unvoiced outputs .__c0
____you know then use that as the ==__c0
__z__uhhuh .__c5
____uh - take the log of that ==__c0
__z__or uh - | pre- - pre- - uh - pre nonlinearity ==__c0
__z__yeah .__c5
____i- - if ==__c5
__z__uh - | and do the k l t on the - on - on that .__c0
__z__yeah .__c5
