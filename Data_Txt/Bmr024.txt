__z__so uh ==__c3
__z__all right .__c2
__s__um - | so i wanted to discuss digits briefly but that won't take too long .__c8
__z__oh good .__c3
__s^rt__right .__c3
__s^t__okay agenda items .__c3
__h|s__uh - | we have digits .__c3
__fh|qh^cs^t^tc.%--__what else we got ?__c3
__fh__new version of the presegmentation .__c1
__s^cc^t3__new version of presegmentation .__c3
__s^cc^t3.%__um - | do we want to say something about the - an update of the uh - transcript ?__c2
__fh|sj^cs^rt^t__yeah | why don't you summarize the ?==__cb
__s^cs__update on transcripts .__c3
__fg|s^co^t__and i guess that includes some - the filtering for the - the a s i refs too .__cb
__fg__huh .__c2
__fg__filtering for what ?__c3
__s^rt^t__for the references that we need to go from the - the fancy transcripts to the sort of brain dead .__cb
__s^bk^rt^t1__it'll - it'll be basically it'll be a recap of a meeting that we had jointly this morning .__c2
__qw^t__uhhuh .__c3
__s^t__with don as well .__cb
__s^bk^t1__uhhuh .__c2
__s^t__got it .__c3
__qw^rt__anything else more pressing than those things ?__c3
__h|s^t__so - | so why don't we just do those ?__c3
__s.%__you said yours was brief so ==__c3
__s^2__okay .__c8
__qw^bu^rt__okay well the w- - uh - | as you can see from the numbers on the digits we're almost done .__c8
__s^rt__the digits goes up to about four thousand .__c8
__qh^cs^t__um - and so uh - | we probably will be done with the t i digits in um - another couple weeks um - depending on how many we read each time .__c8
__s__so there were a bunch that we skipped .__c8
__b__you know someone fills out the form and then they're not at the meeting and so it's blank .__c8
__b__um - | but those are almost all filled in as well .__c8
__b__and so once we're - it's done it would be very nice to train up a recognizer and actually start working with this data .__c8
__fg__so we'll have a corpus that's the size of t i digits ?__c4
__fg|s^rt^t__and so ==__c8
__s^bk^t1__one particular test set of t i digits .__c8
__fg__test set | okay .__c4
__qy^cs^d^rt^t__so i - i extracted - ther- - there was a file sitting around which people have used here as a test set .__c8
__s^t1__it had been randomized and so on .__c8
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__fg__and that's just what i used to generate the order of these particular ones .__c8
__s__great .__c4
__s^t__great .__c4
__s^t__um .__c8
__fg__so i'm impressed by what we could do is take the standard training set for t i digits train up with whatever you know - great features we think we have uh - for instance and then test on uh - this test set .__c3
__s^t__and presumably uh - it should do reasonably well on that .__c3
__s^cc__and then presumably we should go to the distant mike and it should do poorly .__c3
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__right .__c8
__fg|s^t1__and then we should get really smart over the next year or two and it - that should get better .__c3
__s^co__and inc- - increase it by one or two percent yeah .__c8
__s^2^cs.%--__yeah yeah .__c3
__s^bk^t1__um - | but in order to do that we need to extract out the actual digits .__c8
__s__right .__c3
__%-__um - | so that - the reason it's not just a transcript is that there're false starts and misreads and miscues and things like that .__c8
__b__and so i have a set of scripts and x waves where you just select the portion hit r .__c8
__b__um | it tells you what the next one should be and you just look for that .__c8
__sj__you know - | so it - it'll put on the screen the next set is six nine nine two two .__c8
__fh__and you find that and hit the key and it records it in a file in a particular format .__c8
__s^aa__so is this ?==__c3
__fg__and so the - the question is should we have the transcribers do that or should we just do it ?__c8
__fg|sj^na__well some of us .__c8
__qy^cs^d^rt__i've been do- - i've done eight meetings something like that just by hand .__c8
__fh__just myself rather .__c8
__fg__so it will not take long .__c8
__s__um ==__c8
__s__uh - | what - what do you think ?__c3
__fh__my feeling is that ==__c2
__fg|s.%--__we discussed this right before coffee .__c2
__s__and i think it's a - it's a fine idea partly because um - it's not un- - unrelated to their present skill set .__c2
__s__but it will add for them an extra dimension it might be an interesting break for them .__c2
__fh__and also it is contributing to the uh - c- - composition of the transcript .__c2
__s__because we can incorporate those numbers directly and it'll be a more complete transcript .__c2
__s^aa__so i'm - i think it's fine that part .__c2
__fh__there is - there is ==__c8
__s^bk__so you think it's fine to have the transcribers do it ?__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s.%__yeah okay .__c3
__s__there's one other small bit which is just entering the information which at s- - which is at the top of this form onto the computer to go along with the - where the digits are recorded automatically .__c8
__b__good .__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__sj^ba__and so it's just you know - typing in name times - time date and so on .__c8
__fh__um - | which again either they can do but it is you know - firing up an editor or again i can do .__c8
__s^cs__or someone else can do .__c8
__sj^ba__and that you know - i'm not - that - that one i'm not so sure if it's into the - the things that i wanted to use the hours for .__c2
__fh__because the - the time that they'd be spending doing that they wouldn't be able to be putting more words on .__c2
__s^bk__huh .__c3
__s^t.%-__but that's really your choice it's your ==__c2
__s__so | are these two separate tasks that can happen ?__c4
__s^t__or do they have to happen at the same time before ?==__c4
__b__no | they don't have - this - you have to enter the data before you do the second task but they don't have to happen at the same time .__c8
__s__so it's - it's just i have a file whi- - which has this information on it and then when you start using my scripts for extracting the times it adds the times at the bottom of the file .__c8
__fh|s__okay .__c4
__s__and so um - | i mean - it's easy to create the files and leave them blank and so actually we could do it in either order .__c8
__fh__oh okay .__c4
__s__um - | it's - it's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double check to make sure you're entering for the right person .__c8
__qw^bu^d^fa^rt__but either way .__c8
__b.%__yeah .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah | just by way of uh - uh - a uh - order of magnitude uh - um - we've been working with this aurora uh - data set .__c3
__s^bc^ng__and uh - the best score on the nicest part of the data that is where you've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth uh - is about .__c3
__s^m__uh ==__c3
__s^bk__i think the best score was something like five percent uh - error per digit .__c3
__b__so that ==__c3
__fg__per digit .__c8
__s^cs^t^tc__per digit .__c1
__s^co__you're right .__c3
__s^bk__so if you were doing ten digit uh - recognition you would really be in trouble .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s__so - so the - the point there and this is uh - car noise uh - uh - things but - but real - real situation .__c3
__s__well real ==__c3
__s__um - the - uh - | there's one microphone that's close that they have as - as this sort of thing close versus distant .__c3
__s__uh - | but in a car .__c3
__s__instead of - instead of having a projector noise it's - it's car noise .__c3
__fh|s__uh - | but it wasn't artificially added to get some - some artificial signal to noise ratio .__c3
__s__it was just people driving around in a car .__c3
__s^m__so that's - that's an indication a- ==__c3
__s__that was with many sites competing and this was the very best score and so forth .__c3
__s__so more typical numbers like ==__c3
__s__although the models weren't that good .__c4
__s__right ?__c4
__b.%__i mean - the models are pretty crappy ?__c4
__qy^bh__you're right .__c3
__fg__i think that we could have done better on the models .__c3
__s^aa__but the thing is that we got - this - this is the kind of typical number for all of the uh - uh - things in this task all of the um - languages .__c3
__fg__and so i - i think we'd probably - the models would be better in some than in others .__c3
__s__huh .__c4
__sj__um - so uh - anyway | just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard .__c3
__s^bk__huh .__c2
__fh|s^cs__it's going to be fun to see how we compare at this .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s^cs__how did we do on the t i digits ?__c4
__sj__very exciting .__c2
__s^aa__well the prosodics are so much different .__c8
__s__it's going to be strange .__c8
__s^aa__i mean the prosodics are not the same as t i digits for example .__c8
__fg|s__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__so i'm - i'm not sure how much of effect that will have .__c8
__s__what do you mean the prosodics ?__cb
__s^aa__h- - how do ?==__c4
__b__um - | just what we were talking about with grouping .__c8
__s__that with these the grouping - there's no grouping at all and so it's just - the only sort of discontinuity you have is at the beginning and the end .__c8
__fg|s.%--__so what are they doing in aurora ?__cb
__s__are they reading actual phone numbers ?__cb
__s__aurora i don't know .__c8
__s^aa__i don't know what they do in aurora .__c8
__s^m__or a - a digit at a time or ?==__cb
__s^aa__uh - | i'm not sure how ==__c3
__fh|s__because it's ==__cb
__b__no no i mean it's connected - it's connected uh - digits .__c3
__s__connected .__cb
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s^na__so there's also the - not just the prosody but the cross - the cross word modeling is probably quite different .__cb
__b.%__but ==__c3
__%__but - right .__c8
__sj^ba__but | in t i digits they're reading things like zip codes and phone numbers and things like that .__c8
__s^ng__h- - how ==__c4
__b__right .__cb
__s__so it's going to be different .__c8
__b__how do we do on t i digits ?__c4
__fh__i don't remember .__c8
__s^cs__i mean - very good .__c8
__s^cs__right ?__c8
__s__yeah | i mean - we were in the ==__c3
__s^aa__one and a half percent two percent something like that ?__c8
__s^na__uh - | i th- - no i think we got under a percent .__c3
__fh__oh really ?__c8
__s__but it was - but it's - but i mean - the very best system that i saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at - at bell labs or - uh - but - but uh - sort of pulling out all the stops .__c3
__b__okay .__c8
__b__s- - @reject@ it s- - strikes me that there are more - each of them is more informative because it's so random .__c2
__s__all right .__c8
__s__huh .__c4
__b__but i think a lot of systems sort of - get half a percent or three quarters a percent .__c3
__fh__right .__c8
__b.%__and we're - we're in there somewhere .__c3
__s__but that - i mean - it's really - it's - it's close talking mikes no noise clean signal just digits i mean - every- - everything is good .__c8
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__fg__it's the beginning of time in speech recognition .__cb
__s^nd__yes exactly .__c8
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__and we've only recently got it to anywhere near human .__c8
__b__it's like the single cell you know - it's the beginning of life .__cb
__s.%--__pre- - prehistory .__c4
__qy.%--__yeah .__cb
__s^j__and it's still like an order of magnitude worse than what humans do .__c8
__qy^rt__right .__cb
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s__so ==__c8
__s^2__when - when they're wide awake yeah .__c3
__b__yeah .__c8
__s__um .__c3
__fh__after coffee .__c8
__fh__after coffee | right .__c3
__b__not after lunch .__c3
__s__okay so um - | what i'll do then is i'll go ahead and enter this data .__c8
__s^bk__and then hand off to jane and the transcribers to do the actual extraction of the digits .__c8
__s__yeah .__c3
__b.%__yeah .__c3
__b.%__one question i have that - that - i mean - we wouldn't know the answer to now but might do some guessing but i was talking before about doing some model- - modeling of arti- - uh - uh - marking of articulatory features with overlap and so on .__c3
__s^cs__huh .__c8
__s^cs__and - and - um ==__c3
__b__on some subset .__c3
__s^cs__one thought might be to do this uh - on - on the digits or some piece of the digits .__c3
__s^aa__uh - it'd be easier uh - and so forth .__c3
__sj^ba__the only thing is i'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena in w- - i- - i- ==__c3
__s__the reason for doing it is because the - the argument is that certainly with conversational speech the stuff that we've looked at here before um - just doing the simple mapping from um - the phone to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book uh - isn't right .__c3
__b__it isn't actually right .__c3
__s^t__in fact there's these overlapping processes where some voicing some up and then some you know - some nasality is - comes in here and so forth .__c3
__s__and you do this gross thing saying well i guess it's this phone starting there .__c3
__s^co__so uh - | that's the reasoning .__c3
__s^df__but it could be that when we're reading digits because it's - it's for such a limited set that maybe - maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much .__c3
__s^bk__i don't know .__c3
__fh__di- - an- - anybody do you have any - anybody have any opinion about that ?__c3
__qo^rt__and that people might articulate more .__c2
__s.%__and you that might end up with more - a closer correspondence .__c2
__qo^d^rt__uhhuh .__c3
__h|s__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah - that's - i - i agree .__c8
__fh|s.%--__that - it's just ==__c8
__b__sort of less predictability .__c4
__b.%__and - you have to ==__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__well it's definitely true that when people are reading even if they're re reading what they had said spontaneously that they have very different patterns .__cb
__s__it's a - well - | would this corpus really be the right one to even try that on ?__c8
__b__mitch showed that and some dissertations have shown that .__cb
__%__right .__c3
__fg|s__so the fact that they're reading first of all whether they're reading in a room of people or rea- - you know - just the fact that they're reading will make a difference .__cb
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^ng__and depends what you're interested in .__cb
__s__see i don't know .__c3
__s__so may- - maybe the thing will be do - to take some very small subset i- - mean - not have a big program but take a small set uh - subset of the conversational speech and a small subset of the digits .__c3
__fh|qw__and look and - and just get a feeling for it .__c3
__s__um - | just take a look really .__c3
__s__h- - that could - could be an interesting design too because then you'd have the com- - the comparison of the uh - predictable speech versus the less predictable speech .__c2
__b.%__because i don't think anybody is - i - at least i don't know of anybody uh ==__c3
__s__well i don't know the answers .__c3
__s__hey ==__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__and maybe you'd find that it worked in - in the case of the pr- - of the uh - non predictable .__c2
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__have to think about the particular acoustic features to mark too because i mean - some things they wouldn't be able to mark like - uh - you know - uh - tense lax .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__b__some things are really difficult .__c4
__s__you know ?__c4
__s__just listening .__c4
__s__m- - i think we can get ohala in to give us some advice on that .__c8
__fg__well ==__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__s__also i thought you were thinking of a much more restricted set of features that ==__c2
__b__yeah but i - i - i - i was - like he said i was going to bring john in and ask john what he thought .__c3
__b__yeah sure .__c2
__fg__sure .__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__s__right .__c3
__b__but i mean - you want - you want it be restrictive | but you also want it to - to - to have coverage .__c3
__fh|s__right .__c8
__s__you know i- - you should - it should be such that if you - if you uh - if you had o- - um - all of the features determined that you - that you were uh - ch- - have chosen that that would tell you uh - in the steady state case uh - the phone .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__b__so um ==__c3
__b__okay .__c2
__sj__even i guess with vowels that would be pretty hard .__c8
__sj^ba__wouldn't it ?__c8
__b__to identify actually you know - which one it is .__c8
__fg|qy^d^rt__it would seem to me that the points of articulation would be m- - more g- ==__c2
__sj__uh - i mean - that's - i think about articulatory features i think about points of articulation which means uh - rather than vowels .__c2
__s__yeah .__c8
__b__points of articulation ?__c4
__qy^rt.%-__what do you mean ?__c4
__s^2__so is it uh - bilabial or dental or is it you know - palatal .__c2
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c3
__s^r__which - which are all like where - where your tongue comes to rest .__c2
__s__uvular .__c8
__s.%--__place of ar- - place of articulation .__c4
__s.%--__place place .__c3
__fh__place .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c3
__fh|s.%--__@reject@ place .__c1
__fh__thank you what - whatev- - whatever i s- - said that's ==__c2
__fh__okay .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__i really meant place .__c2
__s__okay i see .__c4
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s__okay | we got our jargon then okay .__c3
__fh|s__yeah .__c2
__qy^cs__uh ==__c3
__s__well it's also - | there's really a difference between the pronunciation models in the dictionary and the pronunciations that people produce .__cb
__sj__and so you get some of that information from steve's work on the - on the labeling .__cb
__s__right .__c3
__b__right .__c8
__s^bk__and it really ==__cb
__s__i actually think that data should be used more .__cb
__s^2.%-__that maybe - although i think the meeting context is great - that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence .__cb
__s^na__and you can go from - not from that to the articulatory features but that would be a better starting point for marking the gestural features then data where you don't have that .__cb
__b__because we - you want to know both about the way that they're producing a certain sound and what kinds of - you know - what kinds of phonemic differences you get between these transcribed sequences and the dictionary ones .__cb
__s^rt__well you might be right that mi- - might be the way at getting at what i was talking about .__c3
__b__but the particular reason why i was interested in doing that was because i remember when that happened and john ohala was over here and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones .__c3
__s__uh - | he didn't know what to say about what is the sequence of phones there .__c3
__s__they came up with some compromise .__c3
__s__because that really wasn't what it look like .__c3
__b__right .__cb
__s__it didn't look like a sequence of phones .__c3
__s^df__right .__c8
__b__it look like this blending thing happening here and here and here .__c3
__fh|sj__right .__cb
__qy^d^rt__yeah so you have this feature here and overlap yeah .__c8
__s^aa__there was no name for that .__c4
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__sj^ba__but - right .__cb
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__fg|s__but it still is - there's a - there are two steps .__cb
__b__one - you know - one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something like going to see you tomorrow .__cb
__s^bk__and - or gonta .__c8
__b__right .__c3
__fg__yeah .__c3
__fg__it could be going to or going to or gonta s- - you know .__cb
__s^co^t^tc__right .__c3
__h|s__and yeah .__cb
__s.%--__going to see you tomorrow uh - guh see you tomorrow .__cb
__s^bsc__and that it would be nice to have these intermediate or these - some - these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers had marked or to have people mark those as well .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^co^rt__because it's not um - that easy to go from the dictionary word pronuncia- - the dictionary phone pronunciation to the gestural one without this intermediate or a syllable level kind of representation .__cb
__fh|s__well i don't think morgan's suggesting that we do that though .__c8
__s__do you mean ?==__c3
__fh__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah i mean - i- - i- - i'm jus- - at the moment of course we're just talking about what to provide as a tool for people to do research who have different ideas about how to do it .__c3
__s__so for instance you might have someone who just has a wor- - has words with states and has uh - uh - comes from articulatory gestures to that .__c3
__qw^rt__and someone else might actually want some phonetic uh - intermediate thing .__c3
__h|s__so i think it would be - be best to have all of it if we could .__c3
__s^ar|s^ng__but um ==__c3
__s^bk__but - what i'm imagining is a score like notation where each line is a particular feature .__c8
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__right ?__c8
__s__so you would say you know - it's voiced through here and so you have label here and you have nas- - nasal here .__c8
__qy^d^g^rt__yeah .__c3
__h__and they - they could be overlapping in all sorts of bizarre ways that don't correspond to the timing on phones .__c8
__qy.%-__i mean - this is the kind of reason why ==__c3
__s__i remember when at one of the switchboard workshops that uh - when we talked about doing the transcription project dave talkin said can't be done .__c3
__s.%--__right .__c8
__s^r__he was - he was what - what he meant was that this isn't you know - a sequence of phones .__c3
__fh|s__and when you actually look at switchboard that's not what you see and you know - and it ==__c3
__fh__and in - in fact the inter annotator agreement was not that good .__c8
__fh|qy__right ?__c8
__fg|s.%-__on the harder ones ?__c8
__s__yeah | i mean - it was- ==__c3
__s__it depends how you look at it and ==__cb
__fh|qy__i - i understand what you're saying about this kind of transcription exactly .__cb
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah .__c3
__s__because i've seen - you know - where does the voicing bar start and so forth .__cb
__h|s.%--__yeah .__c3
__fh|s__all i'm saying is that it is useful to have that - the transcription of what was really said and which syllables were reduced .__cb
__s__uh - | if you're going to add the features .__cb
__qy^bu^d^g^rt__it's also useful to have some level of representation which is - is a reduced - it's a pronunciation variant that currently the dictionaries don't give you .__cb
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c3
__b__because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition you - you add confusion .__cb
__s__right .__c3
__fh__so people purposely don't add them .__cb
__s.%-__right .__c3
__s__so it's useful to know which variant was - was produced at least at the phone level .__cb
__s^cs__so it would be - it would be great if we had either these kind of labelings on the same portion of switchboard that steve marked or steve's type markings on this data with these .__c4
__s^cs__right .__cb
__s^cs__that's all i mean .__cb
__s__exactly .__cb
__s__yeah .__c3
__fh|s^cs__exactly .__cb
__s^cs__yeah | no i - i don't disagree with that .__c3
__fg__and steve's type is fairly - it's not that slow .__cb
__sj__uh - uh ==__cb
__s__i don't know exactly what the timing was but ==__cb
__qw__yeah | u- - i don't disagree with it .__c3
__qy^d.%-__the on- - the only thing is that what you actually will end - en- - end up with is something ==__c3
__s__i- - it's all compromised .__c3
__s__right ?__c3
__b__so the string that you end up with isn't actually what happened .__c3
__s__but it's - it's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__cb
__qy^d^rt__and it's more accurate than phone labels .__c4
__s^aa__but - and it's more accurate than the - than the dictionary or if you've got a pronunciation uh - lexicon that has three or four .__c3
__s^aa__the word .__c8
__fg|s.%-__yeah .__c4
__fg|s__this might be have been the fifth one that you tr- - that you pruned or whatever .__c3
__fh__so it's like a continuum .__c4
__b__right .__cb
__s.%--__right .__cb
__s__it's - you're going all the way down .__c4
__s__so sure .__c3
__sj__right .__cb
__s^cs__that's what i meant is ==__cb
__sj^r__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__fg|s^ng__an- - and in some places it would fill in so - the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere .__cb
__s^cs__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__well ==__c8
__qh__right .__c4
__s^aa__so there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram .__cb
__qy^d__uhhuh .__c4
__s^na__but you know what phone it was and that's about all you can - all you can say .__cb
__s__right .__c4
__b__and then there are other cases where nasality voicing ==__cb
__s^cs__it's basically just having multiple levels of - of information and marking on the signal .__c4
__s__right .__cb
__qy__right .__cb
__%__yeah .__c3
__qo__right .__cb
__s__well the other difference is that the - the features are not synchronous .__c8
__s__right ?__c8
__fg|s__they overlap each other in weird ways .__c8
__qy^d^g__uhhuh .__c4
__h|s__uhhuh .__c4
__%__so it's not a strictly one dimensional signal .__c8
__fg__right .__c3
__s^co^t^tc__so i think that's sort of qualitatively different .__c8
__b__right .__cb
__b__you can add the features in | uh - but it'll be underspecified .__cb
__s__huh .__c2
__qy^d__th- - there'll be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features .__cb
__h|s^aa__well not with our current system | but you could imagine designing a system that the states were features rather than phones .__c8
__s__and i- - if you're ==__cb
__sj^fe^t1__well we - we've probably have a separate um - discussion of uh - of whether you can do that .__cb
__fh|s__that's - well isn't that - i thought that was - well but that - wasn't that kind of the direction ?__c2
__%__yeah .__c8
__fh|s^cs__i thought ==__c2
__s.%-__yeah | so i mean - what - what - where this is i mean - i - i want - would like to have something that's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research i have in mind .__c3
__fg__so it should be something broader .__c3
__qw.%--__but the - but uh - where i'm coming from is uh - we're coming off of stuff that larry saul did with - with um - uh - john dalan and muzim rahim in which uh - they uh - have um - a m- - a multi band system that is uh - trained through a combination of gradient learning an- - and e m to um - estimate uh - the uh - value for m- - for - for a particular feature .__c3
__fh__okay ?__c3
__s^bk__and this is part of a larger image that john dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he's sort of imagining that individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate of - of these - these kinds of - something like this .__c3
__qy^d__might not be you know - exact features that jakobson thought of or something .__c3
__fh|s.%--__but i mean - you know - some - something like that .__c3
__s.%--__some kind of low level features which are not fully you know - phone classification .__c3
__qw__and the - the - th- - this particular image of how thi- - how it's done is that then given all of these estimates at that level there's a level above it then which is - is making some kind of sound unit classification such as you know - phone .__c3
__s.%-__and - and you know you could argue what - what a sound unit should be and - and so forth .__c3
__fh|s__but that - that's sort of what i was imagining doing .__c3
__%__um - and - | but it's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones or not .__c3
__s__you wouldn't necessarily have to .__c3
__s^bk__um - but - | again i wouldn't want to - wouldn't want what we - we produced to be so know local - in perspective that it - it was matched what we were thinking of doing one week .__c3
__fh|s.%-__and - and - and  - | you know - what you're saying is absolutely right .__c3
__s^2__that - that if we can we should put in uh - another level of - of description there if we're going to get into some of this low level stuff .__c3
__s^m^na__well you know - um - | i mean - if we're talking about having the annotators annotate these kinds of features it seems like ==__c4
__b__you know - you ==__c4
__b__the - the question is do they do that on meeting data ?__c4
__fh|s__or do they do that on switchboard ?__c4
__fh|s__that's what i was saying .__c8
__s__maybe meeting data isn't the right corpus .__c8
__s.%-__w- - well it seems like you could do both .__c2
__s^bs__i mean - i was thinking that it would be interesting to do it with respect to parts of switchboard anyway in terms of ==__c2
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c3
__s^aa__uh - | partly to see if you could generate first guesses at what the articulatory feature would be based on the phone representation at that lower level .__c2
__s^aa^r__uhhuh .__c3
__%-__it might be a time gain .__c2
__b__but also in terms of comparability of um ==__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__b__well because the - yeah and then also if you did it on switchboard you would have the full continuum of transcriptions .__c4
__%-__what you gain .__c2
__s__yep .__c2
__b__you'd have it from the lowest level the ac- - acoustic features then you'd have the you know - the phonetic level that steve did .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c2
__s__yeah | that - that's all i was thinking about .__cb
__s^bk__and ==__c4
__fh__it is telephone band so the bandwidth might be ==__cb
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__and you could tell that ==__c2
__fh|s__it'd be a complete set then .__c4
__s.%--__and you get the relative gain up ahead .__c2
__fh__it's - so it's a little different .__c3
__qw__yeah .__cb
__sj^fe__so i mean - | i- - you know we'll see wha- - how much we can uh - get the people to do and how much money we'll have and all this sort of thing .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c2
__fh|s__but it - it might be good to do what jane was saying uh - you know - seed it with guesses about what we think the features are based on you know - the phone or steve's transcriptions or something to make it quicker .__c4
__s^bk__but ==__c3
__s__might be do both .__c3
__fh__all right so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous but then you could imagine nudging them here and there .__c8
__s__adjusting .__c4
__s.%-__yeah exactly .__c4
__b__scoot the voicing over a little because ==__c4
__s__yeah .__c2
__qy^g__right .__c8
__s^aa__well i think what - i mean - i'm - i'm a l- - little behind in what they're doing now and uh - the stuff they're doing on switchboard now .__c3
__s.%--__but i think that steve and the gang are doing something with an automatic system first and then doing some adjustment .__c3
__%--__as i re- - as i recall .__c3
__s__so i mean - that's probably the right way to go anyway is to - is to start off with an automatic system with a pretty rich pronunciation dictionary that - that um - you know - tries to label it all .__c3
__s__and then people go through and fix it .__c3
__b__so in - in our case you'd think about us s- - starting with maybe the regular dictionary entry ?__c2
__s__and then ==__c2
__b__well | regular dictionary i mean this is a pretty rich dictionary .__c3
__s__or would we ?__c2
__sj^ba__it's got - got a fair number of pronunciations in it .__c3
__b__or you could start from the - if we were going to do the same set of sentences that steve had done we could start with those transcriptions .__c4
__s.%--__but ==__c2
__%-__uhhuh .__c2
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__that's actually what i was thinking is tha- ==__cb
__b__so i was thinking ==__c2
__b__right .__c8
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__the problem is when you run uh - if you run a regular dictionary um - even if you have variants in there which most people don't you don't always get out the actual pronunciations .__cb
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__so that's why the human transcriber's giving you the - that pronunciation .__cb
__s^cs__yeah .__c2
__fh__actually maybe they're using phone recognizers .__c3
__s__oh .__c2
__fg__and so y- ==__cb
__s__they - they - i thought that they were .__cb
__s^bk__is that what they're doing ?__c3
__b__they are .__c8
__s.%--__we should catch up on what steve is ==__cb
__b__oh okay .__c3
__fh__uh | i think that would be a good i- - good idea .__cb
__b__yeah .__c3
__qy__yeah so i think that i- - i- - we also don't have i mean ==__c3
__s.%--__we've got a good start on it .__c3
__s^aa__but we don't have a really good meeting recorder or recognizer or transcriber or anything yet .__c3
__s^cc__so ==__c3
__s__yeah .__cb
__s.%-__so i mean - another way to look at this is to - is to uh - do some stuff on switchboard which has all this other stuff to it .__c3
__b__and then um - | as we get further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time we can do some of the same things to the meeting data .__c3
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c4
__b__okay .__c2
__fg|qy^d^t^tc__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__and i'm - and these people might - they - they are s- - most of them are trained with i p a .__c2
__fg|s.%--__yeah .__c3
__qy^bsc^d^rt__they'd be able to do phonetic level coding or articulatory .__c2
__s__are they busy for the next couple years or ?==__c4
__s^bc__well you know - i mean - they - they - they're interested in continuing working with us .__c2
__s^bc^r__so - i mean - i - and this would be up their alley so we could - when the - when you d- - meet with with john ohala and find you know - what taxonomy you want to apply then they'd be good to train onto it .__c2
__s__yeah .__c3
__fh|s__yeah .__c3
__fh|s.%--__anyway this is not an urgent thing at all .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__just it came up .__c3
__b.%__it'd be very interesting though to have that data .__c4
__s^nd__yeah .__cb
__s^bk^m__i wonder how would you do a forced alignment ?__c8
__b__i think so too .__c2
__fh|s__might ==__cb
__s.%--__interesting idea .__c2
__s__to - to - i mean - you'd want to iterate somehow .__c8
__qy__yeah .__c8
__sj__it's interesting thing to think about .__c8
__s__it might be ==__cb
__s__huh .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__i was thinking it might be n- ==__cb
__s__i mean - you'd - you'd want models for spreading .__c8
__s^co__of the f- - acoustic features ?__c4
__b__yeah .__c8
__fg|s__uhhuh .__c4
__fh|qy^bu^d__uhhuh .__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__s.%--__well it might be neat to do some phonetic features on these non - word words .__cb
__s^aap__are - are these kinds of words that people never - the huh s and the huh s and the huh and the uh ?__cb
__sj__these k- - no i'm serious .__cb
__s^cs__there are all these kinds of functional uh - elements .__cb
__s^bk__i don't know what you call them .__cb
__s^t3__but not just fill pauses but all kinds of ways of interrupting and so forth .__cb
__b__uhhuh .__c8
__b__and some of them are yeah uhhuh s and huh s and huh .__cb
__s^t3__huh okay uh grunts .__cb
__s__uh ==__cb
__s^co__that might be interesting .__cb
__b__he's got lip - lip smacks .__c2
__s__in the meetings .__cb
__s^na__we should move on .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c2
__b__uh - | new version of uh - presegmentation ?__c3
__b__uh - | oh yeah um - i worked a little bit on the - on the presegmentation to - to get another version which does channel specific uh - speech-nonspeech detection .__c1
__b__and what i did is i used some normalized features which uh - look in- - into the - which is normalized energy uh - energy normalized by the mean over the channels and by the minimum over the other .__c1
__sj^ba.%__within each channel .__c1
__s^j__and | to - to huh - to yeah - to normalize also loudness and - and modified loudness and things and that those special features actually are in my feature vector .__c1
__s^j__oh .__c8
__s__and - and therefore to be able to uh - somewhat distinguish between foreground and background speech in - in the different - in each channel .__c1
__sj^fe^j__and uh - i tested it on - on three or four meetings and it seems to work well yeah fairly well i - i would say .__c1
__s__there are some problems with the lapel mike .__c1
__s__of course .__c8
__%__yeah .__c1
__s^cs__wow that's great .__c8
__s.%--__uh - yeah .__c1
__qy^d^j^rt__and ==__c1
__fg|qy^rt__so i - i understand that's what you were saying about your problem with minimum .__c8
__s.%-__yeah .__c1
__s__and ==__c1
__b__yeah | and - and i had - i had uh - specific problems with ==__c1
__b__i get it .__c8
__s__so new - use ninetieth quartile rather than minimum .__c8
__b__yeah .__c1
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__wow !__c2
__b__yeah - yeah | then i - i did some - some - some things like that .__c1
__sj^fe.%__interesting .__c2
__b__as there - there are some - some problems in - when in the channel there - they - the the speaker doesn't - doesn't talk much or doesn't talk at all .__c1
__%--__then the yeah - there are - there are some problems with - with - with n- - with normalization and then uh - there the system doesn't work at all .__c1
__s^nd__so i'm - i'm glad that there is the - the digit part where everybody is forced to say something .__c1
__b__right .__c3
__%-__so that's - that's great for - for my purpose .__c1
__qr^d__and the thing is i - i - then the evaluation of - of the system is a little bit hard as i don't have any references .__c1
__s.%--__well we did the hand ==__c8
__b__the one by hand .__c8
__b__yeah | that's the one - one wh- - where i do the training on so i can't do the evaluation on .__c1
__b__so the thing is can the transcribers perhaps do some - some - some meetings in - in terms of speech-nonspeech in - in the specific channels ?__c1
__s__uh .__c8
__s__well won't you have that from their transcriptions ?__c4
__fg__well i have ==__c2
__%__well okay | so now we need ==__c2
__b.%__no | because we need is really tight .__c8
__b__yeah .__c1
__qw^rt__so um ==__c2
__b.%__i think i might have done what you're requesting though i did it in the service of a different thing .__c2
__s^bu^m__oh great .__c1
__s__i have thirty minutes that i've more tightly transcribed with reference to individual channels .__c2
__qy^d^rt__okay .__c1
__s^aa__okay that's great .__c1
__b__that's great too .__c1
__s^aa__and i could - and ==__c2
__s^aa__yeah so ==__c1
__s^bk__hopefully that's not the same meeting that we did .__c8
__qw.%--__and ==__c2
__s^cs__no | actually it's a different meeting .__c2
__fg__good .__c8
__s__so um - | e- - so the you know - we have the - th- - they transcribe as if it's one channel with these - with the slashes to separate the overlapping parts .__c2
__%--__okay .__c1
__fg__and then we run it through - then it - then i'm going to edit it and i'm going to run it through channelize which takes it into dave gelbart's form- - format .__c2
__fg|s__yeah .__c1
__qw.%-__yeah .__c1
__fg__and then you have all these things split across according to channel .__c2
__s^ng__and then that means that if a person contributed more than once in a given overlap during that time bend that - that two parts of the utterance end up together it's the same channel .__c2
__qy^d^f^g__and then i took his tool and last night for the first thirty minutes of one of these transcripts i tightened up the um - boundaries on individual speakers' channels .__c2
__qy__okay .__c1
__b__okay .__c1
__qw.%--__because his - his interface allows me to have total flexibility in the time tags across the channels .__c2
__qy__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__c1
__qrr.%--__and um - so .__c2
__s^bk__so current - this week .__c4
__s^bk__so yeah - yeah that - that - that's great but | what would be nice to have some more meetings not just one meeting to - to be sure that - that there is a system .__c1
__s__yes .__c2
__b__might not be what you need .__c2
__fg__yeah so if we could get a couple meetings done with that level of precision i think that would be a good idea .__c8
__s.%-__okay .__c1
__b__oh okay .__c2
__fg|s__yeah .__c1
__%--__uh - how - how m- - much ti- ?==__c2
__b__so the meetings vary in length .__c2
__b__what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you'd like to have as your - as your training set ?__c2
__s__it seems to me that it would be good to have a few minutes from - from different meetings .__c1
__s__so ==__c1
__s^co__but i'm not sure about how much .__c1
__b__okay now you're saying different meetings because of different speakers or because of different audio quality or both or ?==__c2
__s__both .__c1
__s^bk__both .__c1
__qy__okay .__c2
__%-__different - different number of speakers different speakers different conditions .__c1
__%--__yeah | we don't have that much variety in meetings yet .__c3
__s^aa__uh - | i mean - we have this meeting and the feature meeting and we have a couple others that we have uh - couple examples of but - but uh ==__c3
__s__yeah m- ==__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__even probably with the gains differently will affect it you mean ==__c5
__b.%__uh - | not really as ==__c1
__s__poten- - potentially .__c3
__s__oh because you use the normalization ?__c5
__s__because of the normalization | yeah .__c1
__s__okay .__c5
__b__oh okay .__c3
__qy^d^g__yeah .__c1
__fg|s__we can try running ==__cb
__qy^rt__we haven't done this yet because um - uh - andreas an- - is - is going to move over the s r i recognizer .__cb
__s__i- - basically i ran out of machines at s r i .__cb
__s__because we're running the evals .__cb
__fg__okay .__c1
__b__and i just don't have machine time there .__cb
__s__but once that's moved over uh - hopefully in a - a couple days then we can take um - what jane just told us about as the presegmented the - the segmentations that you did at level eight or som- - at some threshold that jane - tha- - right and try doing forced alignment um - on the word strings .__cb
__qw^cs__oh shoot !__c8
__%-__yeah .__c1
__s^ar__yeah .__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__the pre- - presegment .__c2
__%--__yeah .__c1
__s^na__yeah .__c2
__s__with the recognizer ?__c1
__b__yeah .__c1
__s^na^r__and if it's good then that will - that may give you a good boundary .__cb
__%-__of course if it's good we don't - then we're - we're fine .__cb
__fh__yeah .__c1
__fg|qr__m- ==__c1
__s^cs__but i don't know yet whether these segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words will work or not .__cb
__b__i - i would quite like to have some manually transcribed references for - for the system as i'm not sure if - if it's really good to compare with - with some other automatic found boundaries .__c1
__s.%-__yeah .__cb
__qr^d^rt__right .__cb
__qw__well no | if we were to start with this and then tweak it h- - manually would that - that would be okay ?__c2
__s__yeah .__c1
__fg__right .__cb
__%-__yeah sure .__c1
__s.%-__they might be okay .__cb
__s^cs__okay .__c2
__s^cs.%-__it - you know it really depends on a lot of things .__cb
__s^aa__yeah .__c1
__s^na__but i would have maybe a transcriber uh - look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those .__cb
__%-__yeah .__c1
__s__to a- - adjust them or ==__c1
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah yeah .__c1
__s__that might save some time .__cb
__s__if they're horrible it won't help at all .__cb
__b__yeah great .__c1
__s__but they might not be horrible .__cb
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__so - but i'll let you know when we uh - have that .__cb
__b__okay great .__c1
__s__how many minutes would you want from ?==__c2
__b__i mean - we could easily get a section you know - like - say a minute or so from every meeting that we have so f- - from the newer ones that we're working on everyone that we have .__c2
__s__and then ==__c2
__fg__should provide this .__c2
__s.%-__if it's not the first minute of - of the meeting that - that's okay with me .__c1
__qw__but in - in the first minute uh - often there are some - some strange things going on which - which aren't really - well for which - which aren't re- - re- - really good .__c1
__b__so | what - what i'd quite like perhaps is to have some five minutes of - of - of different meetings .__c1
__b__so ==__c1
__s.%--__somewhere not in the very beginning five minutes okay .__c2
__s^bs__yeah .__c1
__s.%--__and then i wanted to ask you just for my inter- - information .__c2
__fh__then would you be trai- ?==__c2
__s__because i don't quite unders- ==__c2
__s.%--__so would you be training then um - the segmenter so that it could on the basis of that segment the rest of the meeting ?__c2
__s__so if i give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to uh - to providing tighter time bands ?__c2
__qy^d^f^g__i - i could do a - a retraining with that yeah .__c1
__s__wow interesting .__c2
__s__that's - but - but i hope that i - i don't need to do it .__c1
__s__okay .__c2
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c2
__b__so uh - it c- - can be do in an unsupervised way .__c1
__s^cs__excellent .__c2
__%-__so ==__c1
__s__excellent okay .__c2
__qy^d^f^g^rt__i'm - i'm not sure .__c1
__s.%-__but for - for - for those three meetings whi- - which i - which i did it seems to be quite well .__c1
__fg|s^df__but there are some - some - as i said some problems with the lapel mike .__c1
__fh|s^e__but perhaps we can do something with - with cross correlations to - to get rid of the - of those .__c1
__fg__and ==__c1
__qy^cs__yeah .__c1
__fh__that's - that's what i - that's my future work .__c1
__s^j__well - well what i want to do is to - to look into cross correlations for - for removing those false overlaps .__c1
__fh|s__wonderful .__c2
__s__are the um - wireless different than the wired mikes at all ?__cb
__s^cs__i mean - have you noticed any difference ?__cb
__qy^d^g__i'm - i'm not sure um - if - if there are any wired mikes in those meetings or uh - i have - have to loo- - have a look at them .__c1
__s.%-__but i'm - i'm - i think there's no difference between .__c1
__fg__so it's just the lapel versus everything else ?__cb
__s^cs__yeah .__c1
__b.%__yeah .__c1
__fh__okay so then if that's five minutes per meeting we've got like twelve minutes - twelve meetings roughly that i'm - that i've been working with then .__c2
__s^cs__of - of - of the meetings that you're working with how many of them are different tha- ?==__c3
__b__no .__c1
__s__are there any of them that are different than these two meetings ?__c3
__s^co__well - oh wa- - in terms of the speakers or the conditions or the ?==__c2
__s^co__yeah speakers .__c3
__s^bk__sorry .__c3
__s^co__so ==__c3
__s__um - | we have different combinations of speakers .__c2
__s^cs__yeah that ==__c1
__qy^d^g__i mean - just from what i've seen uh - there are some where um - you're present or not present .__c2
__s__and then - then you have the difference between the networks group and this group .__c2
__qw__yeah i know some of the n s a meetings yeah .__c1
__qw__yeah .__c3
__s__so i didn't know in the group you had if you had ==__c3
__%--__yeah .__c1
__s^bk__so you have the networks meeting ?__c3
__qy^bu^d__yep we do .__c2
__s^aa__yeah .__c1
__b__do you have any of jerry's meetings in your pack uh ?==__c3
__s__um - | no .__c2
__s__no .__c3
__s^df__we could ==__c2
__s^bk__i mean - you - you recorded one last week or so .__c2
__b__i could get that new one in this week - i get that new one in .__c2
__b__yep .__c8
__fg__we're going to be recording them every monday .__cb
__s__u- ==__c8
__sj^ba__yeah .__c3
__%--__because i think he really needs variety .__c3
__sj^ba^r__so ==__cb
__sj__and - and having as much variety for speaker certainly would be a big part of that i think .__c3
__fh__great .__c2
__qy^rt__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__yeah .__c1
__qy.%-__okay so if i ==__c2
__s^aa__okay - included - include ==__c2
__s^aa__okay - then uh - if i were to include all together samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour .__c2
__s^aa^r__and i could get the transcribers to do that .__c2
__sj^ba__right ?__c2
__b__i mean - what i mean is that would be an hour sampled and then they'd transcribe those - that hour .__c2
__s__right ?__c2
__sj__that's what i should do ?__c2
__sj__yeah .__c3
__b__and ==__c3
__qy^d^g__right .__c3
__b__ye- - but you're - y- ==__c3
__s^cs^t3__that's - that's ==__c1
__b__i don't mean transcribe .__c2
__b__i mean - i mean adjust .__c2
__b__so they get it into the multi channel format and then adjust the timebands so it's precise .__c2
__s^no^t3__so that should be faster than the ten times kind of thing .__c3
__b__absolutely .__c2
__fg__yeah .__c3
__b__i did - i did um - uh - so last night i did - uh ==__c2
__s__oh gosh .__c2
__s^t3__well last night i did about half an hour in three hours which is not terrific .__c2
__s^cs__yeah .__c3
__qy^t3__but um ==__c2
__s^j^t3__yeah .__c3
__%--__anyway it's an hour and a half per ==__c2
__b__well that's probably ==__c3
__s__so ==__c1
__s^na__well i can't calculate on my - on my feet .__c2
__b__do the transcribers actually start wi- - with uh - transcribing new meetings or are they ?==__c1
__qy^bu^rt__well um - | they're still working - they still have enough to finish that i haven't assigned a new meeting .__c2
__s^arp__okay .__c1
__s^na__but the next m- - m- ==__c2
__fh|s^na__i was about to need to assign a new meeting .__c2
__s__and i was going to take it from one of the new ones .__c2
__s^bk__okay .__c1
__s__and i could easily give them jerry feldman's meeting .__c2
__fh__no problem .__c2
__qr__and then ==__c2
__s__okay .__c1
__s__so they're really running out of data prett- - i mean - that's good .__cb
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c2
__s__uh - that first set .__c2
__%--__um - okay .__cb
__s^bu__they're running out of data unless we s- - make the decision that we should go over and start uh - transcribing the other set .__c3
__s__so ==__cb
__s^bsc__there - the first - the first half .__c3
__s__and so i was in the process of like - editing them but this is wonderful news .__c2
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__okay .__c1
__s^cs__all right .__c3
__s__we funded the experiment with uh ==__c2
__b__also we were thinking maybe applying that - that to getting the ==__c2
__fg|s.%--__yeah | that'll be very useful to getting the overlaps to be more precise all the way through .__c2
__%--__so this blends nicely into the update on transcripts .__c3
__s^cs__yes it does .__c2
__fg__okay .__c3
__s^nd__so um - um - liz and - and don and i met this morning in the barco room with the lecture hall .__c2
__s^j^na.%--__yeah please .__cb
__b__go ahead .__cb
__s^j__and this afternoon .__cb
__b__and this afternoon .__c2
__s^bk__it drifted into the afternoon uh - concerning this issue of um - the - well there's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that they need to do for the s r i recognizer .__c2
__s^r.%__and um - | well so i mentioned the process that i'm going through with the data .__c2
__s^co__so you know - i get the data back from the transcri- - well s- - uh - metaphorically get the data back from the transcriber .__c2
__s__and then i check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that .__c2
__b__and um - i'm going to be doing a more thorough editing with respect to consistency of the conventions .__c2
__fh__but they're - they're generally very good .__c2
__s^tc__and then i run it through uh - the channelize program to get it into the multi channel format okay .__c2
__s^co__and the what we discussed this morning i would summarize as saying that um - these units that result in a - a particular channel and a particular timeband at - at that level um - vary in length .__c2
__b__and um - their recognizer would prefer that the units not be overly long .__c2
__s^co__but it's really an empirical question whether the units we get at this point through just that process i described might be sufficient for them .__c2
__b__so as a first pass through a first chance without having to do a lot of hand editing what we're going to do is i'll run it through channelize give them those data after i've done the editing process and be sure it's clean .__c2
__s^cs__and i can do that pretty quickly with just that minimal editing without having to hand break things .__c2
__s^nd__uhhuh .__c3
__s^cs__and then we'll see if the units that we're getting uh - with the - at that level are sufficient .__c2
__b__and maybe they don't need to be further broken down .__c2
__s^r__and if they do need to be further broken down then maybe it just be piece wise maybe it won't be the whole thing .__c2
__b__so that's - that's what we were discussing this morning as far as i - among ==__c2
__s^cs__right .__cb
__b__also we discussed some adaptational things .__c2
__s^na.%--__then lots of ==__cb
__s__right .__cb
__b__so it's like ==__c2
__fh__uh - | you know i hadn't uh - incorporated a convention explicitly to handle acronyms for example .__c2
__s__but if someone says p z m it would be nice to have that be directly interpretable from the transcript what they said .__c2
__fh__uhhuh .__c3
__s__or pi- - uh - tcl t c l i mean .__c2
__s^nd__it's like ==__c2
__s__y- - it's - and so um - i've - i've incorporated also convention with that .__c2
__s^aap__but that's easy to handle at the post editing phase .__c2
__s^df__and i'll mention it to transcribers for the next phase .__c2
__s__but that's okay .__c2
__%--__and then a similar conv- - uh - convention for numbers .__c2
__qw^cs__so if they say one eighty three versus one eight three .__c2
__fg__um - | and also i'll be um - encoding as i do my post editing the things that are in curly brackets which are clarificational material .__c2
__s^na__and uh - to incorporate uh - keyword at the beginning .__c2
__s__so it's going to be either a gloss or it's going to be a vocal sound like a laugh or a cough or so forth .__c2
__s^bk__or a non vocal sound like a doors- - door slam and that can be easily done with a you know - just a - one little additional thing in the - in the general format .__c2
__s__yeah | we j- - we just needed a way to strip you know - all the comments all the things th- - the - that linguist wants but the recognizer can't do anything with .__cb
__s^bk__um - | but to keep things that we mapped to like - reject models or you know - uh - mouth noise or cough .__cb
__fh__and then there's this interesting issue jane brought up .__cb
__%-__which i hadn't thought about before .__cb
__qy^d^rt__but i was realizing as i went through the transcripts that there are some noises like ==__cb
__s^aa__um ==__cb
__s^aa__well the - good example was an in breath where a transcriber working from the mixed signal doesn't know whose breath it is .__cb
__qrr__right .__c8
__s^ar__and they've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct .__cb
__s^nd__and what we do is if it's a breath sound you know - a sound from the speaker we map it to a noise model like a mouth noise model in the recognizer .__cb
__s^bk__and yeah - it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these .__cb
__s__but if they're in the wrong channel that's not a good idea .__cb
__s^co__and then there's also things like door-slams that's really in no one's channel .__cb
__b__they're like - it's in the room .__cb
__qw^d__right .__c8
__s__yeah .__c1
__qy.%-__and uh - jane had this nice uh - idea of having like - an extra uh - couple tiers ==__cb
__qy^bu^d^rt__an extra channel .__c8
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__sj^fe__yeah .__cb
__b__i've been - i've been adding that to the ones i've been editing .__c2
__%--__and we were thinking that is useful also when there's uncertainties .__cb
__s__so if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker's channel .__cb
__b__because maybe it was someone else's breath .__cb
__fh__or uh ==__cb
__fg|s.%-__so i think that's a good - you can always clean that up post processing .__cb
__s__yeah .__c2
__s.%-__so a lot of little details .__cb
__s^nd__but i think we're coming to some kind of closure on that .__cb
__s^aa__so the idea is then uh - don can take uh - jane's post processed channelized version and with some scripts you know convert - that to - to a reference for the recognizer .__cb
__s^na|s^arp__and we can - can run these .__cb
__%-__so when that's ready - you know - as soon as that's ready and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get twelve hours of force aligned and recognized data .__cb
__s__and you know - start working on it .__cb
__s__and ==__c2
__s.%-__so we're i don't know - a coup- - a week or two away i would say from .__cb
__s.%-__uh - if - if that process is automatic once we get your post process transcript .__cb
__qy^arp^d^rt__uhhuh .__c2
__s^bsc__and that doesn't - the amount of editing that it would require is not very much either .__c2
__s^na__i'm just hoping that the units that are provided in that way will be sufficient .__c2
__s^bsc__because i would save a lot of uh - time dividing things .__c2
__b__yeah | some of them are quite long .__cb
__s^bsc__just from ==__cb
__b.%__i don't know .__cb
__fg__how long were ?==__cb
__b.%__you did one ?==__cb
__s__i saw a couple around twenty seconds .__c5
__s__and that was just without looking too hard for it .__c5
__qr__so i would imagine that there might be some that are longer .__c5
__b__right .__cb
__s__well | n- ==__c2
__s__one question .__c2
__b__e- - w- - would that be a single speaker or is that multiple speakers overlapping ?__c2
__s.%-__no no | but if we're going to segment it ==__c5
__s.%--__like if there's one speaker in there that says okay or something right in the middle it's going to have a lot of dead time around it .__c5
__s^bsc__right | it's not the - it's not the fact that we can't process a twenty second segment it's the fact that there's twenty seconds in which to place one word in the wrong place .__cb
__s__so it's not ==__c5
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__fh|s.%--__you know if - if someone has a very short utterance there .__cb
__s__yeah .__c2
__s.%-__and that's where we might want to have this individual you know - ha- - have your pre- - pre process input .__cb
__s__yep .__c1
__s^cs__yeah .__c1
__b__sure .__c1
__s__and i just don't know .__cb
__qw.%-__i - i - i thought that perhaps the transcribers could start then from the - those mult- - multi channel uh - speech-nonspeech detections if they would like to .__c1
__fh|s__that's very important .__c2
__fg|qw^cs__i have to run it .__cb
__s.%--__right .__cb
__fh__in - in doing the hand marking ?__c2
__s^cs__yeah .__c1
__s^bk__yeah | that's what i was thinking too .__c2
__s__right .__cb
__b__so that's probably what will happen .__cb
__s__yeah .__c2
__b__but we'll try it this way and see .__cb
__s__yeah .__c1
__s.%--__i mean it's probably good enough for force alignment .__cb
__s__if it's not then we're really - then we def- - definitely ==__cb
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__uh - but for free recognition i'm - it'll probably not be good enough .__cb
__qy.%--__we'll probably get lots of errors because of the cross talk and noises and things .__cb
__s.%--__yep .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__good .__c3
__s^aa__s- - i think that's probably our agenda or starting up there .__c3
__s^aa__oh | i wanted to ask one thing .__c2
__s^bk__yeah ?__c3
__s^bu__the microphones - the new microphones .__c2
__b__when do we get uh ?==__c2
__s^aa__uh - | they said it would take about a week .__c8
__b__oh | exciting .__c2
__s^arp__k .__c2
__%-__k .__c3
__s__you ordered them already ?__c4
__s^df__uhhuh .__c8
__%-__great .__c4
__b__so what happens to our old microphones ?__cb
__b__they go where old microphones go .__c3
__b__um ==__c8
__s^cs__do we give them to someone ?__cb
__s^2^na__or ?==__cb
__s.%--__well the only thing we're going to have extra for now ==__c8
__b__we don't have more receivers .__cb
__b__we just have ==__cb
__s__right | we don- ==__c8
__s__right .__cb
__s^2__so the only thing we'll have extra now is just the lapel .__c8
__b__not - not the bodypack .__c8
__s__just the lapel .__c8
__b__just the lapel itself .__cb
__s__um - and then one of the - one of those .__c8
__fg|s.%-__since what i decided to do on morgan's suggestion was just get two new microphones um - and try them out .__c8
__s^co__uhhuh .__cb
__s__and then if we like them we'll get more .__c8
__fg|s.%--__okay .__cb
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^df__since they're - they're like two hundred bucks a piece .__c8
__b__we won't uh - at least try them out .__c8
__s__so it's a replacement for this headset mike .__c4
__b__yep yep .__c8
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^aap__and they're going to do the wiring for us .__c8
__s__what's the um - style of the headset ?__c4
__s__it's um - it's by crown .__c8
__s^arp__and it's one of these sort of mount around the ear thingies .__c8
__s__and uh - when i s- - when i mentioned that we thought it was uncomfortable he said it was a common problem with the sony .__c8
__fg__and this is how apparently a lot of people are getting around it .__c8
__s.%-__huh .__c4
__s__and i checked on the web and every site i went to raved about this particular mike .__c8
__b__it's apparently comfortable and stays on the head well .__c8
__s__so we'll see if it's any good .__c8
__s^bk__but uh - i think it's promising .__c8
__s^bk__you said it was used by aerobics instructors ?__c2
__s^bk__yup .__c8
__qy^cs.%-__yep yep | so it was - it was advertised for performers .__c8
__qh^co^nd__huh .__c5
__s^ar__that says a lot .__c2
__s^df^nd__for the recor- - for the record adam is not a paid employee or a consultant of crown .__c3
__qw^cs__and ==__c8
__s^cs__excuse me ?__c8
__s^cs__oh .__c2
__s^arp^cs__excuse me ?__c8
__s__right .__cb
__fh__i said for the record adam is - is not a paid consultant or employee of crown .__c3
__s.%--__that's right .__c8
__s^no__however he may be solicited after these meetings are distributed .__cb
__qw__well we're using the crown p z ms .__c8
__qy.%-__don't worry about finishing your dissertation .__cb
__s^no__yeah .__c3
__%-__these are crown .__c8
__b__aren't they ?__c8
__s__the p z ms are crown .__c8
__qy^bu^d__all right .__c3
__s^aa__aren't they ?__c8
__s__yeah .__c3
__s.%-__yeah | i thought they were .__c8
__fg__you bet - you bet .__c3
__qy^rt__and they work very well .__c8
__b__yes .__cb
__qy^d^rt__so if we go to a workshop about all this - this it's going to be a meeting about meetings about meetings .__c3
__qy^rt__okay .__c3
__%-__so ==__c3
__qw^rt__and then it - we have to go to the planning session for that workshop .__c8
__%-__oh yeah | what - which will be the meeting about the meeting about the meeting .__c3
__fg__oh god .__c4
__fh__because then it would be a meeting about the meeting about the meeting about meetings .__c8
__fg__ooh .__c2
__fg__yeah .__c3
__sj^ba__just start saying m four .__c3
__s__yeah okay .__c3
__b__yeah .__c8
__s__m to the fourth .__c8
__qy^d^f^g__should we do the digits ?__c3
__s^bs^cs__yep | go for it .__c8
__b__okay .__c3
