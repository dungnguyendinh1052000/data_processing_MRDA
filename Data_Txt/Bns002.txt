__z__and we already got the crash out of the way .__c4
__z__it did crash so i feel much better earlier .__c4
__z__@@ .__c8
__z__yeah .__c8
__fg__interesting .__c5
__s^rt__will you get the door ?__c8
__fh|s^rt^t__huh .__c5
__s__and ==__c8
__s^rt__@@ .__c8
__s__okay ==__c8
__s^e__okay so um ==__c4
__s^df__you collected an agenda | huh ?__c8
__qy^bu^d.%--__i did collect an agenda .__c4
__s^aa|s^df^na__so i'm going to go first .__c4
__s^bk__mwa-ha-ha !__c4
__s^cs^e__it shouldn't take too long .__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__fh|s.%-__um so we're pretty much out of digits .__c4
__s^fa|s__we've gone once through the set .__c4
__s__um so the only thing i have to do ==__c4
__s__no | there's only ten .__c8
__s__yeah that's right .__c4
__s.%--__so i - i just have to go through them .__c4
__s^aa__well okay .__c8
__fh__and uh | pick out the ones that have problems .__c4
__s^bu__and either correct them or have them reread .__c4
__s^aa__so we probably have like four or five more forms to be read to be once through the set .__c4
__s__i've also extracted out about an hour's worth .__c4
__s^aa__we have about two hours worth .__c4
__s^bk__i extracted out about an hour's worth .__c4
__s__which are the f- - digits with - for which whose speaker have speaker forms .__c4
__%-__have filled out speaker forms .__c4
__s^bk__not everyone's filled out a speaker form .__c4
__b__so i extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms .__c4
__s__and for meetings in which the key file and the transcript files are parsable .__c4
__s^bk__some of the early key files it looks like were done by hand .__c4
__b__and so they're not automatically parsable .__c4
__s^bk__and i have to go back and fix those .__c4
__s^ft__so what that means is we have about an hour of transcribed digits that we can play with .__c4
__s__um ==__c4
__fh__so you think two - you think two hours is the - is the total that we have .__c8
__fh__liz ==__c4
__fh|s__yep .__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__fh|s^e__and you think we- - th- - uh ==__c8
__s^bk__i - i didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right .__c8
__s^ft__but you think we'll be able to retrieve the other hour reasonably ?__c8
__s^cc^rt__yes absolutely .__c4
__s^cc__okay .__c8
__fh__so it's just a question of a little hand editing of some files .__c4
__fh__and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms .__c4
__s^am__i have this web based speaker form .__c4
__s__and i sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form .__c4
__s__and they're slowly s- - trickling in .__c4
__fh__so the relevance of the speaker form here s- ==__c8
__s__it's for labeling the extracted audio files .__c4
__s__oh okay .__c8
__fh__by speaker i. d and microphone type .__c4
__s^t__wasn't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits or something .__c8
__s^t__no | i spoke with jane about that .__c4
__s__and we sort of decided that it's probably not an issue that ==__c4
__s__we edit out any of the errors anyway | right ?__c4
__s^t__yeah .__c8
__s^df^t__so the- - there are no errors in the digits .__c4
__s^bk__you'll always read the string correctly .__c4
__fh__so i can't imagine why anyone would care .__c4
__s^bk__so the other topic with digits is uh ==__c4
__s^co^t^tc__liz would like to elicit different prosodics .__c4
__s^ft__and so we tried last week with them written out in english .__c4
__s__and it just didn't work at all .__c4
__s__because no one grouped them together .__c4
__fh|s^cc__so it just sounded like many many more lines instead of anything else .__c4
__s__so in conversations with liz and uh jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number social security number like readings .__c4
__s^cc^rt__the problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits .__c4
__s__when i look at this that first line is sixty one sixty two eighteen eighty six ten .__c4
__s__um and so the question is does anyone care ?__c4
__fh|s^cc__um i've already spoken with liz and she feels that correct me if i'm wrong that for her connected numbers is fine .__c4
__s^cc__uhhuh .__c5
__fh|s__as opposed to connected digits .__c4
__s^df__um i think two hours is probably fine for a test set .__c4
__s^df__but it may be a little short if we actually want to do training and adaptation and all that other stuff .__c4
__s^df__yeah .__c8
__fh|s__um do um ==__c8
__fh__you want different prosodics .__c8
__s__so if you always had the same groupings you wouldn't like that ?__c8
__s^df__is that correct ?__c8
__s__well we actually figured out a way to ==__cb
__s__yeah | the - the ==__c4
__fh__the - the groupings are randomly generated .__cb
__s__no | but i was asking if that was something you really cared about .__c8
__fh__because if it wasn't it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings that maybe people wouldn't uh go and do numbers so much .__c8
__fh|s__you know if it- - if it's ==__c8
__s__i think they may still do it .__cb
__s__uh ==__c1
__s__um ==__cb
__s__maybe some | but i- - probably not so much .__c8
__s^e^rt__what about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group ?__c2
__s^e__and ==__cb
__s^e__right ?__c8
__s^e__so if you - if - if you have uh ==__c8
__s^bk__six dash one you mean ?__c4
__qw__if you go six six six uh dash uh two nine three one .__c8
__s__i - well okay - | i - it might help ==__cb
__s^df__i would like to g- - get away from having only one specific grouping .__cb
__s^df__that's what i was asking | yeah .__c8
__s^na__um | so if that's your question .__cb
__s__yeah .__c8
__qy^d^g^rt__but i mean it seems to me that at least for us we can learn to read them as digits .__cb
__s^na__if that's what people want .__cb
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__s^na__i - i'm ==__cb
__b__yeah .__c5
__s__don't think that'd be that hard to read them as single digits .__cb
__s^bk__i agree .__c5
__s__um ==__cb
__fh__and it seems like that might be better for you guys .__cb
__s__since then you'll have just more digit data .__cb
__s^e__right .__c4
__s^bk__and that's always a good thing .__cb
__s^e__it's a little bit better for me too .__cb
__s^e__yep .__c4
__s__because the digits are easier to recognize .__cb
__s__they're better trained than the numbers .__cb
__s__right .__c8
__s^e__so we could just uh put in the instructions read them as digits .__c4
__fh__right right | read them as single digits .__cb
__s__so sixty one w- - is read as six one .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__and if people make a mistake we ==__cb
__%__how about o.  versus zero ?__c4
__s__i mean the other thing is we could just bag it .__c8
__s^e^rt__because it's - it's ==__c8
__s^e__it's- - i'm not worrying about it .__c8
__s__i mean because we do have digits training data that we have from uh from o. g. i .__c8
__fh|s^e^rt__i'm sorry .__c8
__fh__digits - numbers training that we have from o. g. i .__c8
__s^e__we've done lots and lots of studies with that .__c8
__s^e^rt__and um ==__c8
__s^df__but it's nice to get it in this room with the acous- ==__cb
__qy^d__yeah .__c8
__h|qy^rt__i mean - for - it's ==__cb
__s^df__no no i guess what i'm saying is that ==__c8
__s^ba^df__just let them read it how they read it .__c4
__s^bk__to some extent maybe we could just read them - have them read how - how they read it .__c8
__fh__and it just means that we have to expand our - our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have .__c8
__fh__right .__cb
__s^ba__well that's fine with me as long as - it's just that i didn't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits .__cb
__s^ng__yeah .__c8
__s__so ==__cb
__s^df__we can go back to the other thing later .__c8
__s:qw__i mean we s- - we - we've - we can do this for awhile .__c8
__s^bk__okay .__cb
__s^na__and then go back to digits for awhile .__c8
__fh|s__or um ==__c8
__b__do yo- - i mean do you want - do you want this do you need training data or adaptation data out of this ?__c8
__s^e__okay .__cb
__s^bk__how much of this do you need ?__c8
__b__with uh the ==__c8
__s^e__it's actually unclear right now .__cb
__fh|s^df__i just thought well we're - if we're collec- - collecting digits and adam had said we were running out of the t. i forms i thought it'd be nice to have them in groups .__cb
__s__and probably all else being equal it'd be better for me to just have single digits .__cb
__b__since it's you know a recognizer's going to do better on those anyway .__cb
__s^co__okay .__c8
__b__um and it's more predictable .__cb
__s^bk__so we can know from the transcript what the person said and the transcriber in general .__cb
__s__okay | well if you pre- ==__c8
__qw__but if they make mistakes it's no big deal .__cb
__b__if the people say a hundred instead of one o. o .__cb
__fh|s__and also w- - maybe we can just let them choose zero versus o.  as they - as they like .__cb
__s^bk__because even the same person c- - sometimes says o.  and sometimes says zero in different context .__cb
__s^bk__yeah .__c8
__fh__and that's sort of interesting .__cb
__s^bk__so i don't have a specific need .__cb
__s__because if i did i'd probably try to collect it you know without bothering this group .__cb
__s^ft__but if we can try it ==__cb
__s^bk__okay | so - so i can just add to the instructions to read it as digits .__c4
__s^bk__not as connected numbers .__c4
__s^bk__right | and you can give an example .__cb
__fg__uhhuh .__c5
__fh|s__like you know six - sixty one would be read as six one .__cb
__s^e__right .__c4
__s__and i think people will get it .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s^df__and i- - actually it's no more artificial than what we've been doing with words .__c5
__s^df__i'm sure people can adapt to this .__c5
__s^bk__right right .__cb
__s__read it single .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__it's just easier to read .__cb
__s__the spaces already bias it toward being separated .__c5
__s^e__right .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__and i know i'm going to find this easier than words .__c5
__s^e__oh yeah absolutely .__c4
__fh__okay- ==__cb
__s:s^bk__cognitively it's much easier .__c4
__s:s^na__i also had a hard - hard time with the words .__cb
__qh^cs^rt__but then we went back and forth on that .__cb
__s^df__yeah .__c8
__s__okay so let's give that a try .__cb
__fh__okay | and is the spacing all right or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ?__c4
__s^ba__okay .__c8
__s^df__and ==__cb
__s^df__i mean what do other people think ?__cb
__s__or is that all right ?__c4
__s__because you guys are reading them .__cb
__s__i think that i- - it's fine .__c5
__s__i- - it - it - to me it looks like you've got the func- - the idea of grouping and you have the grou- - the idea of separation .__c5
__s^df__okay .__c4
__s^df__okay .__cb
__s^df__and you know it's just a matter of u- - i- - the instructions that's all .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__great | okay .__cb
__%-__well let's give it a try .__cb
__s__and i think there are about ten different gouping patterns .__c4
__s__let's try it .__c8
__qy^d^f^g__isn't that right liz ?__c4
__s^df__righ- - right | and you just - they're randomly generated and randomly assigned to digits .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__that we did .__c4
__s^ba__i did ==__c5
__s__so we have ==__c8
__fh|s__uhhuh .__c5
__fh|s__sorry .__c8
__s^df__go ahead .__c5
__s__i - i was just going to say so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of - of recordings now .__c8
__s__and you're saying two hours uh is digits .__c8
__s__so that's roughly the ratio then .__c8
__s__something like twenty - twenty to one .__c8
__qy^d^f^g__yep .__c4
__fh|s__which i guess makes - makes sense .__c8
__fh|s__so if we did another forty hours of recordings then we could get another couple hours of this .__c8
__qy^d^f^g__right .__c4
__s__um yeah like you say i think a couple hours for a - for a - for a test - test set's okay .__c8
__s__it'd be nice to get you know more later .__c8
__s^bd__because we'll - we might use - use this up uh in some sense .__c8
__s^bd__uhhuh .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__but - but uh ==__c8
__s__right .__c4
__s__yeah | i also would like to argue for that .__c5
__s__because it - it seems to me that um there's a real strength in having the same test replicated in - a whole bunch of times .__c5
__qy^d^f^g^rt__and adding to that basic test bank .__c5
__fh__right .__c4
__qw__huh .__c5
__qw__because then you have you know more and more u- - chances to get away from random errors .__c5
__s__and i think um the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups .__c5
__s^df__and it might be - there might be an argument to be made for having uh f- - for replicating all of the digits that we've done .__c5
__s__which were done by non native speakers .__c5
__s^rt__so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set .__c5
__s__which is totally american speakers .__c5
__s__and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database .__c5
__s__right .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__i think that uh trying to duplicate spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing t. i. digits probably isn't too worthwhile .__c4
__s__because the recording situation is so different .__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c8
__fh|s.%--__it's going to be very hard to be comparable .__c4
__s^fa__except that if you have the stimuli comparable then it says something about the - the contribution of setting .__c5
__fh|%--__no | it's - it's not the same .__c8
__s^rt__a little bit .__c8
__s.%-__and ==__c5
__fg__but the other differences are so major .__c8
__s^ar__okay .__c5
__%-__they're such major sources of variance that it's - it's - it's uh ==__c8
__s^aa__yeah | i mean read versus not .__c4
__s^bk__what's an example of a - of m- - some of the other differences ?__c5
__%__any other a- - difference ?__c5
__s__well i- - i- - individual human glottis is going to be different for each one .__c8
__s^ft__okay .__c5
__fh__you know it's just - there's so many things .__c8
__s__okay .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__it's - it - and - and enunciation .__c8
__s^df__well and not just that .__c4
__s__i mean the uh the corpus itself .__c4
__s^bk__i mean we're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list .__c4
__s__and i'm sure that they're doing more specific stuff .__c4
__s__i mean if i remember correctly it was like postman reading zipcodes and things like that .__c4
__fh__t. i. digits was ?__c8
__s__i thought - i thought it was read .__c8
__s__i thought so .__c4
__fh__was it read ?__c4
__s__yeah | i think the reading zipcode stuff you're thinking of would be o. g. i .__c8
__fh__oh | i may well be .__c4
__s__yeah no t. i. digits was read in th- - in read in the studio i believe .__c8
__b__i haven't ever listened to t. i. digits .__c4
__fg__yeah .__c8
__s^bk__so i don't really know how it compares .__c4
__qy^cs__yeah .__c8
__s^aa__but it - but ==__c8
__s^aa|s.%-__but - but regardless it's going to - it's hard to compare cross corpus .__c4
__s.%-__it- - it's different people is the - is the core thing .__c8
__s__so ==__c4
__s.%--__and they're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth .__c8
__s^bk__okay fine .__c5
__b__so it's - it's - it's really pretty different .__c8
__s^bk__but i think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework .__c8
__s^bk__so that even though you couldn't do exact comparisons it wouldn't be s- - valid scientifically at least it'd give you some kind of uh frame of reference .__c8
__s__uh you know it's not ==__c8
__s.%--__okay .__c5
__fh__hey liz | what - what do the groupings represent ?__c2
__s__you said there's like ten different groupings .__c2
__s^df__right | just groupings in terms of number of groups in a line .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__and number of digits in a group .__cb
__s__and the pattern of groupings .__cb
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c2
__s__are the patterns - like are they based on anything or ?==__c2
__s__um | i - i just roughly looked at what kinds of digit strings are out there .__cb
__s__and they're usually grouped into either two three or four - four digits at a time .__cb
__s__oh .__c2
__s^bk__and they can have ==__cb
__s.%-__i mean actually things are getting longer and longer .__cb
__qy^d^rt__in the old days you probably only had three sequences and telephone numbers were less and so forth .__cb
__qrr.%--__so there's between um ==__cb
__h__well if you look at it there are between like three and five groups .__cb
__s^aa__and each one has between two and four groupings .__cb
__s^aa^r__and ==__cb
__s^bk__i purposely didn't want them to look like they were in any kind of pattern .__cb
__s^df__huh .__c2
__s^df__so ==__cb
__s^df__and which group appears is picked randomly and what the numbers are are picked randomly .__c4
__qy^d^f^g^rt__uhhuh .__c2
__fh__right .__cb
__s__so unlike the previous one which i d- - simply replicated t. i. digits this is generated randomly .__c4
__s^bk__huh oh okay .__c2
__fg__oh okay .__c1
__s__but i think it'd be great i- - to be able to compare digits .__cb
__fh|qw__whether it's these digits or t. i. digits to speakers um and compare that to their spontaneous speech .__cb
__qy^rt__and then we do need you know a fair amount of - of digit data .__cb
__qrr__because you might be wearing a different microphone .__cb
__s.%-__and i mean - so it's - it's nice to have the digits you know replicated many times .__cb
__s^df__uhhuh .__c4
__s^df__especially for speakers that don't talk a lot .__cb
__s^df__so um ==__cb
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__s.%--__for adaptation .__cb
__s^df__no | i'm serious .__cb
__s^bk__so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation .__cb
__s__yeah .__c8
__s__yeah | all we have for some people is digits .__c4
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__and we're not using the digit data now .__cb
__s^ba__but you know ==__cb
__s__oh | you're not .__c4
__s^bk__not for adaptation | nope .__cb
__fh__v- - w- - we're not - we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on .__cb
__s^bu__and i'd - as soon as someone started to read transcript number that's read speech .__cb
__s.%-__and i thought well we're going to do better on that .__cb
__s^aa__oh i see .__c4
__s__that's not fair to use .__cb
__s^bk__oh yeah | that's true absolutely .__c4
__s__but it might be fair to use the data for adaptation .__cb
__s__okay .__c1
__qy^d^f^g__so ==__cb
__s^bk__so those speakers who are very quiet shy ==__cb
__%-__that would be interesting to see whether that helps .__c4
__s:s^bk__r- - right .__cb
__s:qw__do you think that would help adapting on ?==__c4
__s__like adam ?__c2
__s^e__yeah .__c4
__s^e__yeah .__c8
__s^na__yeah | i have a real problem with that .__c4
__b__well it sh- - i mean it's the same micropho- ==__cb
__s__see the nice thing is we have that in the - in the same meeting .__cb
__s^e__right .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__yeah .__c8
__b__and so you don't get ==__cb
__fh__same - same acoustics .__c4
__s^ba__same microphone .__c4
__s__same channel .__c4
__fh__yeah .__c1
__s__right | and so i still like the idea of having some kind of digit data .__cb
__s^df__okay .__c4
__s^bk__good .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__yeah | i mean for the - for the um acoustic research ==__c8
__s__for the signal processing farfield stuff i see it as - as - as the place that we start .__c8
__s^aa__but th- - i mean it'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data .__c8
__s__but - but uh the truth is i'm hoping that we - we through the - the stuff that - that you guys have been doing as you continue that we get uh the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff uh uh nearfield .__c8
__s^bu__and then um we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the farfield .__c8
__qy^d^g^rt__and at some point when we feel it's mature and we understand what's going on with it then we - we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield .__c8
__s^aa__so ==__c8
__s^df__the only thing that we don't have ==__cb
__s^bk__great .__c5
__s^bk__i know this sounds weird .__cb
__fh__and maybe it's completely stupid .__cb
__s__but we don't have any overlapping digits .__cb
__s.%-__yeah | we talked about that a couple times .__c4
__s^e.%--__an- - yea- - i know it's weird .__cb
__s^bk__but um ==__cb
__s^bk__overlapping digits .__c1
__s^co.%-__the - the problem i see with trying to do overlapping digits is the cognitive load .__c4
__s^cs.%--__all right | everybody's laughing .__cb
__s^ba__okay .__cb
__s^co.%--__dueling digits .__c3
__fg|s^cs__no | it's - it's not stupid .__c4
__qy^d^rt__it's just - i mean try to do it .__c4
__s__i'm just talkin- - for the stuff that like dan ellis is going to try .__cb
__s__i mean here let's try it .__c4
__s^aa__you know cross talk cancellation .__cb
__s__let's try it .__c8
__b__you read the last line i'll read the first line .__c4
__s^co__okay .__cb
__%__oh .__c1
__s^bk__wait - oh it - these are all the same forms .__cb
__s^aa__sixty one .__c8
__s^cs__okay | so but ==__cb
__s^rt__so - so you read the last line i'll read the first line .__c4
__s^df__so you plu- - you plug your ears .__cb
__s^bk__no | i'll p- ==__c8
__s^bu|qy^d^g^rt__oh | i guess if you plug you're ears you could do it .__c4
__b__but then you don't get the - the same effects .__c4
__s^2__yeah .__c1
__s^na__well what i mean is actually no- - not the overlaps that are well governed linguistically .__cb
__s__but the actual fact that there is speech coming from two people .__cb
__s^df__and the beam forming stuf- ==__cb
__b__yeah .__c4
__s|qy^d^g^rt__all the acoustic stuff that like dan ellis and - and company want to do .__cb
__s^bk__oh i see .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__digits are nice and well behaved .__cb
__s^na__i mean ==__cb
__%-__anyway it's just a thought .__cb
__s^bk__i guess we could try .__c4
__s__we could try doing some .__c4
__s__it - it would go faster .__cb
__s^bk__parallel .__c2
__s^bk|s^nd__it would take one around amount of ti- ==__cb
__fh__it's the p. make of digit reading .__c2
__s^df__well - well okay | well let's try it .__c4
__qy^bh__that's right .__cb
__s^bk__i - i mea- - i'm - i was sort of serious .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__but i really i mean i'm - i don't feel strongly enough that it's a good idea .__cb
__s^rt__see y- ==__c8
__s^aa__you do the last line i'll do the first line .__c4
__s^e__so ==__cb
__s^df__okay .__c8
__s^bu__DIGIT_TASK__c4
__s^bu__DIGIT_TASK__c8
__s^aa__that's not bad .__c4
__s^aa|s.%-__no | i can do it .__c8
__qy^rt__a- - and that prosody was great by the way .__cb
__s^df__i couldn't understand a single thing you guys were saying .__c2
__s^ar__i think it was numbers .__c5
__s^df__but i'm not sure .__c5
__qw^rt__it - it sort of sounded like a duet or something .__cb
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__s^e__performance art .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__all right | let's try three at once you - you pick one in the middle .__c8
__s^aa__the aurora theater .__c1
__s^bk__okay .__cb
__s^bk__go .__c8
__s^bu__DIGIT_TASK__c4
__s^aa__DIGIT_TASK__c8
__s^na__DIGIT_TASK__cb
__s^e^na__i'm sorry .__cb
__s^bu__i'm mean i think it's doable .__cb
__s^aa__the poor transcribers .__c4
__s^aa__i'm just ==__cb
__qy^d^g^rt__they're going to hate us .__c4
__s^aa^r__so we - we could have a round like where you do two at a time .__cb
__s.%-__and then the next person picks up when the first guy's done or something .__cb
__s^e__so pairwise .__c1
__s__oh | like a round .__c8
__b__yeah | like in a - a ==__c8
__b__like a ==__cb
__fh__yeah | just pairwise .__c1
__s__yeah .__c8
__qy^d^f^g__what do you call it ?__cb
__s^df__li- - a r- - like ==__cb
__s^df__a round .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__or ==__c1
__s__row row row your boat .__c8
__%__round .__c3
__b__yeah .__c1
__qy^d^f^g__uhhuh .__c4
__s^aa__yeah .__c8
__s^aa__yeah | like that .__cb
__s^bk__okay .__c8
__fg__it's going to require some coordination .__c2
__fg|s__then it would go like h- - twice as fast or a third as fast .__cb
__s^bk__anyway it's just a thought .__cb
__fh__you have to have a similar pace .__c5
__s^ba__yeah .__c8
__qy__i'm actually sort of serious if it would help people do that kind o- ==__cb
__s^aa|s^co__but the people who want to work on it we should talk to them .__cb
__%-__i don't think we're going to collect vast amounts of data that way .__c8
__s^bk__so ==__cb
__s^rt__huh .__c4
__s^rt__but i think having a little bit might at least be fun for somebody like dan to play around with .__c8
__s__okay .__cb
__s^bk__i think maybe if we wanted to do that we would do it as a separate session .__c4
__s.%--__yeah .__c8
__s__yeah .__cb
__s^bk__something like that .__c4
__s__rather than doing it during a real meeting .__c4
__s^bk__and you know do two people at a time .__c4
__s^bk__then three people at a time and things like that .__c4
__s__so ==__c4
__b__can try it out .__cb
__b__if we have nothing - if we have no agenda we could do it some week .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__see - see what dan thinks .__c4
__fh__yeah right .__c4
__s__yeah yeah .__c8
__s__okay .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__spend the whole time reading digits with different qu- - quantities .__c8
__s__c- - c- - can i- - can i have an- - another - another question w- - about this ?__c5
__s__i thought this was going to be fast .__c4
__b__oh well .__c4
__s__so um there are these digits .__c5
__s^aa__which are detached digits .__c5
__fh|s__but there are other words that contain the same general phon- - phoneme sequences .__c5
__s^bk__like wonderful has one in it .__c5
__qy^g^rt__and - and victor borge had a - had a piece on this where he inflated the digits .__c5
__s^aa__well i wonder if there's um an- - if there would be a value in having digits that are in essence embedded in real words to compare in terms of like the articulation of one in wonderful versus one as a digit being read .__c5
__s^bu__that's two bad .__c8
__s__yeah .__c8
__%--__i'm all four it .__cb
__s^ar__there you go .__c5
__s^ar^r__not after i eight though .__c4
__%-__uh they don't all work as well | do they ?__c8
__s^co__huh .__c8
__s|qy^d^g^rt__what does nine work in ?__c8
__s^bk__uh ==__c4
__s^bk__uh ==__c8
__s__nein !__c3
__s^aa__you scream it .__c3
__b__nein .__c4
__s^aa__oh | in german .__c8
__b__you have to be german .__c4
__s^bk__it's great for the germans .__c2
__s__yeah .__c8
__s^bk__that's german yeah .__c1
__b__oh oh .__cb
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__nein .__c5
__s__that's right .__c8
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__s^bk__oh .__c4
__b__it only sounds w- - good when you scream it though .__c3
__s__so ==__c3
__b__i think everybody's a little punchy here today .__c8
__b__well i mean i just wanted to offer that as a possible task .__c5
__s__yes .__c8
__s^aa__because you know if we were to each read his embedded numbers words in sent- - in sentences .__c5
__s__because it's like an entire sketch he does .__c5
__s__and i wouldn't take the inflated version .__c5
__s^bk__so he talks about the woman being two-derful .__c5
__fh__and ==__c5
__fh__and - a- - but you know if it were to be deflated just the normal word it would be like a little story that we could read .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__s__i don't know if it would be useful for comparison .__c5
__s^df__but it's embedded numbers .__c5
__s^bk__well i don't know .__c8
__fh__i think for something like that we'd be better off doing like uh timit .__c4
__s__well i think the question is what the research is .__c8
__s__so i mean i presume that the reason that you wanted to have these digits this way is because you wanted to actually do some research looking at the prosodic form here .__c8
__b__huh .__c4
__s__right yeah .__cb
__b__yeah okay .__c8
__s^bk__so if somebody wanted to do that if they wanted to look at the - the - the difference of the uh phones in the digits in the context of a word versus uh the digits - a - a non digit word versus in digit word uh that would be a good thing to do .__c8
__s__but i think someone would have to express interest in that .__c8
__s^df__i see .__c5
__h|s^aa__i think to ==__c8
__s^bu__okay .__c5
__h|s^nd__i mean if you were interested in it then we could do it for instance .__c8
__fh|s^am__okay | thank you .__c5
__s^am^df__huh .__c5
__s^bk__okay | are we done with digits ?__c4
__s^bk__um ==__c4
__qy^d^f^g__we have a. s. r results from liz .__c4
__b__transcript status from jane .__c4
__s^ng__and disk space and storage formats from don .__c4
__s^am__does - do we have any prefer- - preference on which way we want to - we want to go ?__c4
__%__well i was actually going to skip the a. s. r results part in favor of getting the transcription stuff talked about .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__b__since i think that's more important to moving forward .__cb
__s__but i mean morgan has this paper copy .__cb
__b__and if people have questions ==__cb
__s__um it's pretty preliminary in terms of a. s. r results .__cb
__s__because we didn't do anything fancy .__cb
__fg__but i think e- - just having the results there .__cb
__fg__and pointing out some main conclusions .__cb
__s__like it's not the speaking style that differs .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__it's the fact that there's overlap that causes recognition errors .__cb
__s__and then the fact that it's almost all insertion errors .__cb
__s^df__which you would expect .__cb
__s.%-__but you might also think that in the overlapped regions you would get substitutions and so forth .__cb
__fh__um | leads us to believe that doing a better segmentation like your channel based segmentation or some kind of uh echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the - on the close talking mikes .__cb
__s.%--__um why don't you if you have a hard copy why don't you email it to the list ?__c4
__s__so these ==__c1
__s__so that's about the summary .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__but this is - morgan has this paper .__cb
__s^ar|s^ng__yeah yeah .__c1
__fg__i mean he - he ==__cb
__fg__yeah | so it's the same thing ?__c8
__s__oh | it's in the paper .__c4
__s^bk__it - it's that paper .__cb
__b__it's the same thing i mailed to every- - everybody that w- - where it was .__c8
__b__okay .__c4
__s__yeah yeah .__cb
__s^bk__so we basically um did a lot of work on that .__cb
__fh|s__okay | then it's already been mailed .__c4
__s__yeah .__c8
__s^bk__and it's ==__cb
__s.%--__let's see th- ==__cb
__b__i guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure w- - that the lapel you know within speaker is bad .__cb
__s^e__horrible ?__c4
__b__and it's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech .__cb
__s__so your - your a. s. r results were run on the channels synchronized .__c1
__b__yes | because that's all that w- - had been transcribed at the time .__cb
__s^bk__okay .__c1
__s^e__okay .__c1
__fg__okay .__c1
__b__um ==__cb
__s^bk__but as we - i mean i wanted to here more about the transcription .__cb
__s__if we can get the channel asynchronous or the ==__cb
__qr.%--__yeah .__c1
__fh__the closer t- ==__cb
__qy^d.%--__that would be very interesting for us .__cb
__s.%-__because we ==__cb
__s.%-__so if ==__c2
__h|s^nd__yeah | that's - that's why i only used the part from use- - .__c8
__s^df__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__which we had uh about uh about the alt- - over all the channels .__c8
__%--__yeah .__c1
__s^na__right .__cb
__%-__that's ==__cb
__s.%--__yeah sure .__c1
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__s^bk|s__or mixed channel .__c8
__s^bk__rather mixed signal .__c8
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__so if there was a segment of speech this long ==__c2
__b__because ==__cb
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^bk__and someone said oh in the front - in the middle .__c4
__s__and oh and someone said oh the whole thing was passed to the recognizer .__c2
__%-__there were several speakers in it .__c1
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__that's right | in fact i - i pulled out a couple classic examples in case you want to u- - use them in your talk of ==__cb
__s^df__uhhuh .__c3
__s__that's why there's so many insertion errors .__c2
__s^df__chuck on the lapel .__cb
__b__so chuck wore the lapel three out of four times .__cb
__s^bk__huh .__c3
__s^e__i noticed that chuck was wearing the lapel a lot .__c4
__s^e__um yeah .__cb
__b__early on | yeah .__c2
__s^bk|s__and i wore the lapel once .__cb
__s^e__and for me the lapel was okay .__cb
__b__i mean i still ==__cb
__b__and i don't know why .__cb
__fh__i'm ==__cb
__s__but um ==__cb
__fg__for you it was ==__cb
__s^df__probably how you wear it - wore it i would guess .__c4
__b__or who was next to me or something like that .__cb
__b__yeah | where you were sitting probably affected it .__c3
__s^df__yeah .__c1
__b__right | but when chuck wore the lapel and morgan was talking there're a couple really long utterances .__cb
__fh__where chuck is saying a few things inside .__cb
__s__and it's picking up all of morgan's words pretty well .__cb
__s^e__and so the rec- - you know there're error rates ==__cb
__s^am^e__because of insertion ==__cb
__fh__insertions aren't bounded .__cb
__s__so with a one word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__and that's - that's where the problems come in .__cb
__fh|s__so i- - this is sort of what we expected .__cb
__fh__but it's nice to be able to - to show it .__cb
__s__right .__c4
__s__and also i just wanted to mention briefly that um uh andreas and i called up dan ellis who's still stuck in switzerland .__cb
__s__and we were going to ask him if - if there're you know what's out there in terms of echo cancellation and things like that .__cb
__s__not that we were going to do it .__cb
__s__but we wanted to know what would need to be done .__cb
__s__and he said lots lots lots lots .__c4
__fh|s__and | he - we've given him the data we have so far .__cb
__s.%--__so these sychronous cases where there are overlap .__cb
__s^ba__yep .__c1
__s__and he's going to look into trying to run some things that are out there .__cb
__fh|s__and see how well it can do .__cb
__fh__because right now we're not able to actually report on recognition in a real paper .__cb
__s__so ==__c2
__s^rt__like a eurospeech paper .__cb
__s^rt__because it would look sort of premature .__cb
__s__so ==__c2
__s__so the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody's only speaking a small amount in it .__c2
__s^bsc__and then try to figure out where they're speaking based on the other peopl- ==__c2
__qy^d^f^g.%__right | or who's - at any point in time who's the foreground speaker .__cb
__s^e__who's the background speaker .__cb
__s^e__i thought we were just going to move the boundaries in .__c2
__s^df__so yeah ==__c1
__s__so ==__cb
__s__yeah | should it ?==__c1
__qy^d^f^g__well that's with the hand stuff .__c4
__qw__so there's like ==__cb
__s__but how would you do that automatically ?__c4
__qy^d^f^g__right .__c2
__s__uh i've actually done some experiments with cross correlation .__c1
__qy^d^f^g__well ther- - there's ==__cb
__s__and it seems to work pretty well to - to get rid of those - those overlaps .__c1
__qy^d^f^g__uhhuh .__c8
__s__i mean that- - that's the sort of thing that you would do .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__yeah .__cb
__s__yeah exactly | so it's - it's a ==__cb
__s^df__so ==__c4
__s^bk|s__yeah .__c1
__qy^d^f^g__so why do you want to do echo cancellation ?__c2
__s^bk__um it would be techniques used from adaptive - adaptive echo cancellation .__cb
__s^aa__which i don't know enough about to talk about .__cb
__qy__uhhuh .__c2
__s__it - just - it just to r- - to remove cross talk .__c8
__s^bk|%-__um ==__cb
__qy__but ==__cb
__%__yeah .__c3
__s^bu__yeah .__c8
__%__right | um and that would be similar to what you're also trying to do .__cb
__%__but using um you know more than energy .__cb
__s^aa__i - i don't know what exactly would go into it .__cb
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah sure .__c1
__s^df__so the idea is to basically run this on the whole meeting .__cb
__fh|s__so it would be ==__c2
__s^bk__and get the locations which gives you also the time boundaries of the individual speak- ==__cb
__s__okay .__c2
__s^e__so do sort of what he's already - what he's trying to do .__c2
__s^e__right | except that there are many techniques for the kinds of cues um that you can use to do that .__cb
__s^bk__okay i s- - i see .__c2
__s^e__yeah | in another way .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^df__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__i see .__c2
__s^bk__yeah | dave - dave uh is um also going to be doin- - usin- - playing around with echo cancellation for the nearfield farfield stuff .__c8
__qy^d^f^g__so ==__cb
__s^df__so we'll be ==__c8
__s__and i guess espen .__cb
__s__this - is - uh - is he here too ?__cb
__s^df__may also be working ==__cb
__qy^d^f^g__yeah .__c8
__s__so it would just be ver- ==__cb
__s__that's really the next step .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__because we can't do too much you know on term- - in terms of recognition results knowing that this is a big problem .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s^e__um until we can do that kind of processing .__cb
__s__and so once we have some some of yours .__cb
__s.%--__okay .__c1
__s__yeah | i'm working on it .__c1
__fh|s__and @@ we'll move on .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__i think this also ties into one of the things that jane is going to talk about too .__c2
__s__um ==__c4
__s__okay .__cb
__s.%-__uhhuh uhhuh .__c5
__qw.%--__i also wanted to say i have done all this chopping up of digits .__c4
__s^fa__so i have some naming conventions that we should try to agree on .__c4
__qw^rt__oh right .__cb
__s__so let's do that off line .__c4
__fh__we don't need to do it during the meeting .__c4
__s^e.%-__yeah .__cb
__s^bk__right .__cb
__s__okay .__c3
__qy^d^ng^rt__definitely ==__cb
__s^aa__uh and don should ==__cb
__s.%-__and - and i have scripts that will extract it out from key files .__c4
__s^df__and - and do all the naming automatically .__c4
__%--__okay .__cb
__s^ar|%-__so you don't have to do it by hand .__c4
__s^bk|s__all right .__c3
__qy^d^f^g__great .__cb
__s^e__so that- - that's it for the ==__cb
__qy^d^f^g__you've compiled the list of uh speaker names .__c3
__s^bk__speakers and ==__cb
__fh|s__uhhuh .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__okay .__cb
__s__not names .__c3
__s^e__but i. d.'s .__c3
__s^ar|%--__yep .__c4
__s__yeah names - names in the - names to i. d.'s .__c4
__s^ar|s^fa__so you ==__c4
__s^na__okay .__c3
__s^fa__great .__cb
__s__and it does all sorts of matches .__c4
__s__because the way people filled out names is different on every single file .__c4
__s^aa__so it does a very fuzzy sort of match .__c4
__s^na__right .__cb
__s__cool .__c3
__s^df__so at this point we can sort of finalize the naming and so forth .__cb
__s^bk__yep .__c4
__fg__and we're going to basically re- - rewrite out these waveforms that we did .__cb
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk^r__because as you notice in the paper your m. o. four in one meeting .__cb
__s^bk^r__and m. o. two  in another meeting .__cb
__s^bk__and it's - we just need to standardize the ==__cb
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__that was my fault .__c3
__qy^d^f^g__um ==__cb
__fg|s.%--__no | it's - it's ==__cb
__s^cc^t1__no | i didn't notice that actually .__c8
__fh__um that's why those comments are s- - are in there .__cb
__s^t1.%--__@@ .__c8
__s^t1.%--__yeah .__c3
__fh__yep .__c4
__s^t1__then disregard it then .__c3
__qy^d^f^g__so th- - i now have a script that you can just say basically look up morgan .__c4
__s^aa|s^na__so ==__cb
__s__right .__cb
__s^t3__yeah .__c8
__s^e__okay .__cb
__s^e__and it will give you his i. d .__c4
__s^bk__great great .__cb
__s^df__okay .__c3
__s__so ==__c4
__s__terrific .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__um ==__c4
__s__all right .__c4
__s^df__do we ?==__c4
__qy^d^f^g__don you had disk space and storage formats ?__c4
__s__is that something we need to talk about at the meeting ?__c4
__s^df__or should you just talk with chuck at some other time ?__c4
__s.%--__um | i had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening waveforms .__c3
__s^e__and i don't know exactly who to ask .__c3
__s^bk|s__i thought that maybe you would be the the person to talk to .__c3
__s^bk__so is it a lossless compression when you compress ?==__c3
__%__uhhuh .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__so ==__c3
__s__entropy coding .__c4
__b__it just uses entropy coding ?__c3
__fg__so ==__c4
__fh|s__okay .__c3
__fh__so i mean i guess my question would be is ==__c3
__s^df__i just got this new eighteen gig drive installed .__c3
__b__um yeah .__c3
__b__which is ==__c3
__fh|s__and i assume half of it is scratch and half of it is ==__c4
__s^df.%-__i'm not exactly sure how they partitioned it .__c3
__fg__probably | yeah .__c4
__s^na__but um ==__c3
__b__that's typical huh .__c8
__s^cs^ng__yeah | i don't know what's typical here .__c3
__s^bk__but um ==__c3
__s^e__it's local though .__c3
__s^aa__so ==__c3
__s^aa__that doesn't matter .__c4
__s^e__but ==__c3
__s__you can access it from anywhere in icsi .__c4
__s^df__okay .__c3
__s^e__in fact this is an eighteen gig drive or is it a thirty six gig drive with eighteen ?==__c8
__s^df__all right .__c3
__b__how do you do that ?__c3
__b__n.  ==__c4
__s^e__eighteen .__c3
__s__eigh- - eighteen .__cb
__s^e__it was a spare that dave had around .__cb
__s__oh okay .__c8
__s^e__slash n.  slash machine name slash x. a.  in all likelihood .__c4
__s^df__oh i see .__c3
__s^df__okay .__c3
__s__all right | i did know that .__c3
__fh|s__um | so the - the only question is how much of it ?==__c4
__fh__the distinction between scratch and non scratch is whether it's backed up or not .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__fh|s__right .__c3
__s__so what you want to do is use the scratch for stuff that you can regenerate .__c4
__fh|s.%--__okay .__c3
__s^df__so ==__c4
__s__the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal .__c4
__s^df__because disks don't crash very frequently .__c4
__qy^d^f^g^rt__right .__c3
__fh|s__as long as you can regenerate it .__c4
__s__right .__c3
__s^df__yeah it's ==__cb
__s^df__i mean all of this stuff can be regenerated .__c3
__qw__it's just a question ==__c3
__s^df__well the ==__cb
__qy^d^f^g__then put it all on scratch .__c4
__s__because we're - icsi is - is bottlenecked by backup .__c4
__s^rt.%--__yeah .__cb
__s__uhhuh very good point .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__okay .__c3
__s^df__well i'd leave all the - all the transcript stuff shouldn't - should be backed up .__cb
__b__so we want to put ==__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__but all the waveform sound files should not be backed up .__cb
__b.%__yeah | i guess ==__c3
__b__right .__c3
__s^bk__the ones that you write out .__cb
__fg|s__okay .__c3
__s__so i mean i guess th- - the other question was then should we shorten them downsample them or keep them in their original form ?__c3
__qy^rt__um ==__c3
__s^e__it just depends on your tools .__c4
__qy__i mean because it's not backed up and it's just on scratch if your sc- - tools can't take shortened format i would leave them expanded .__c4
__b__right .__c3
__s^aa__so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you want to do anything .__c4
__s^df__okay .__c3
__s^df^e__we can downsample them .__cb
__fg|s__do you think that'd be okay ?__c3
__qy__so ==__cb
__s^bk__yeah .__cb
__s__to downsample them .__c3
__s^e__yeah | we get the same performance .__cb
__s__okay .__c3
__s__i mean the r- - the front end on the s. r. i recognizer just downsamples them on the fly .__cb
__s^bd__yeah | i guess the only argument against downsampling is to preserve just the original files in case we want to experiment with different filtering techniques .__c3
__s^df^rt__so ==__cb
__s__so that's ==__cb
__s__i - i - i'm sorry ==__c8
__s__yeah | if ==__cb
__qy^d^f^g^rt__yeah | l- - i mean over all our data we - we want to not downsample .__c8
__s^bk__fe- ==__cb
__fh__you'd - you want to not ==__cb
__s.%--__okay .__cb
__s.%--__so we're - what we're doing is we're writing out ==__cb
__s__yeah .__c8
__s^df__i mean this is just a question .__cb
__s^df^e__we're writing out these individual segments that wherever there's a time boundary from thilo or - or jane's transcribers you know we - we chop it there .__cb
__s^e__yeah .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__b__and the reason is so that we can feed it to the recognizer .__cb
__s^e__uhhuh .__c8
__%-__and throw out ones that we're not using and so forth .__cb
__s^e.%-__yeah .__c8
__fg|s^df.%-__and those are the ones that we're storing .__cb
__s__yeah | as i said since that's - it's regeneratable what i would do is take downsample it .__c4
__s^df.%--__so ==__cb
__s__yeah .__cb
__s__and compress it however you're e- - the s. r. i recognizer wants to take it in .__c4
__s.%--__yeah .__cb
__s.%--__so we can't shorten them .__cb
__s^df__ye- ==__c8
__s__but we can downsample them .__cb
__s__right .__c3
__s^f__yeah | i mean ==__c8
__fg|s^bd__yeah | i'm sorry .__c8
__s__so ==__cb
__s^e__as - yeah as long as there is a - a form that we can come from again that is not downsampled then ==__c8
__b__r- ==__c3
__fh|qy__yeah .__c3
__s^rt__oh yeah | th- ==__cb
__s__yeah | those are going to be kept .__c3
__s__yeah yeah .__cb
__s^bk|%-__that - that's why we need more disk space .__cb
__s^bk__uuu ==__c8
__%--__because we're basically duplicating the originals um ==__cb
__s^fa__yeah .__c8
__s__then it's fine .__c8
__s^e__right .__c4
__b__but for - for - fu- - future research we'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on .__c8
__b__oh yeah .__cb
__s^e__no | we always have the original long ones .__cb
__fg|s^bk__yep .__c4
__b__right .__c3
__b__we would like to ==__c8
__s^bk__yeah .__c8
__fg__so the s. r. i front end won't take a uh - an - an - a large audio file name and then a - a list of segments to chop out from that large audio file ?__c2
__s^bk__they actually have to be chopped out already .__c2
__s^cs__um it's better if they're chopped out .__cb
__b__and - and it - it will be ==__cb
__s^df__uhhuh .__c2
__b__yeah y- - we could probably write something to do that .__cb
__s.%-__but it's actually convenient to have them chopped out .__cb
__s^2__because you can run them you know in different orders .__cb
__s^e__you c- - you can actually move them around .__cb
__s^df.%--__and that's the whole point about the naming conventions .__c4
__s^2__uh you can get rid of- ==__cb
__s^rt__is that you could run all the english speaking .__c4
__s^bk__yeah | it- - it's a lot faster .__cb
__s^rt__all the native speakers .__c4
__s^aa__right | you can grab everything with the word the in it .__cb
__s^ba__and all the non native speakers .__c4
__s__and all the men and all the women .__c4
__%-__and it's ==__cb
__s__yeah .__c4
__s.%--__that's a lot quicker than actually trying to access the wavefile each time .__cb
__s__find the time boundaries and ==__cb
__s.%--__so in principle yeah you could do that .__cb
__s^bsc__i don't - i don't think that's really right .__c2
__s__but it's ==__cb
__fh__but it's um ==__cb
__s__that's just not right man .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__these are long - these are long ==__cb
__s__the - the point ==__c4
__s^f__so - so s- - for example what if you wanted to run - run all the native speakers ?__c4
__s^df.%--__you know ==__cb
__fh__this is an hour of speech .__cb
__s__right | so if - if you did it that way you would have to generate a program that looks in the database somewhere .__c4
__b__extracts out the language .__c4
__s^f__finds the time marks for that particular one .__c4
__s^df__do it that way .__c4
__s__the way they're doing it you have that already extracted .__c4
__s__and it's embedded in the file name .__c4
__s__and so you know you just say ==__c4
__s__we- - yeah | that's - so that's part of it .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__y- - so you just say you know asterisk e.  asterisk dot wave and you get what you want .__c4
__fh|s__is ==__cb
__s^bk__right .__cb
__s^t^tc__and the other part is just that once they're written out it - it is a lot faster to - to process them .__cb
__s^rt__rather than doing seeks through the file .__c4
__s^rt__so ==__cb
__s^rt__otherwise you're just accessing ==__cb
__s^e^rt__this is all just temporary access .__c4
__fh__so i don't - i think - it's all just ==__c4
__s__it's fine .__c4
__s^rt__you know .__c4
__s^e__fine to do it however is convenient .__c4
__s__right .__cb
__s__i mean it just depends how big the file is .__c8
__s__if the file sits in memory you can do extremely fast seeks .__c8
__s__right .__cb
__fh__the other thing is that believe it or not i mean we have some ==__cb
__s__but ==__c8
__s^e__yeah | and they don't .__c4
__s__two gig .__c4
__s^e__so we're also looking at these in waves like for the alignments and so forth .__cb
__s.%--__you can't load an hour of speech into x. waves .__cb
__fh__yeah .__c8
__s__you need to s- - have these small files .__cb
__s^df^rt__and in fact even for the transcriber program um ==__cb
__s^rt__yes you can .__c4
__s^df__yeah | you - you can give waves a start and an end time .__c2
__s^e__yeah if you try to load s- - really long waveform into x. waves you'll be waiting there for ==__cb
__s__and middle .__c2
__s__no | i - i'm not suggesting you load a long wave file .__c2
__s__oh .__cb
__s^e__i'm just saying you give it a start and an end time .__c2
__s^fa|s__and it'll just go and pull out that section .__c2
__s^rt__i th- ==__c4
__s^rt__w- - the transcribers didn't have any problem with that .__c4
__s^rt__did they jane ?__c4
__s^rt__what's th- - u- - w- - in what respect ?__c5
__s^rt__loading the long ==__cb
__s__they loaded - they loaded the long - long files into x. waves .__c4
__s__no | with the transcriber tool it's no problem .__c1
__s__it takes a very long ti- ==__cb
__s__in the - in- ==__c5
__s__yeah just to load a transcription .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__@@ .__c1
__fh__right .__cb
__s__it takes a l- - very long time .__cb
__s__takes a long time .__c1
__fh|s__but not for the wavefile .__c1
__s^rt__the wavefile is there immediately .__c1
__s__uhhuh yeah .__c5
__s^e__are you talking about transcriber or x. waves ?__c4
__s^bk__huh .__cb
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__%--__oh i'm tr- - talking about transcriber .__c1
__s^rt__actually you're talking about transcriber | right ?__cb
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__it was also true of the digits task which was x. waves .__c5
__qw__because because i- - we used x. waves to do the digits .__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__s^bu^e__and they were loading the full mixed files then .__c4
__s__very quickly .__c5
__s^bk__and it didn't seem to be any problem .__c4
__s^bk__i agree .__c5
__s^e__huh .__cb
__b__well we - we have a problem with that .__cb
__qy^d^f^g.%__you know time wise on a ==__cb
__fh|s__it- - it's a lot slower to load in a long file .__cb
__s__huh .__c4
__s^df__seemed really fast .__c4
__s^e__and also to check the file .__cb
__s__so if you have a transcript um ==__cb
__fh__well regardless it's ==__c4
__s__i mean it's ==__cb
__b__yeah .__c8
__s^e__i - i think overall you could get everything to work by accessing the same waveform and trying to find two - you know the begin and end times .__cb
__s__um ==__cb
__b__but i think it's more efficient if we have the storage space to have the small ones .__cb
__fh__and it's no problem | right ?__c4
__s__yeah it's ==__cb
__s^e__because it's not backed up .__c4
__s.%-__yeah .__cb
__s__it's - it's just ==__cb
__s^bk__so we just ==__c4
__s__if we don't have a spare disk sitting around we go out and we buy ourselves an eighty gigabyte drive .__c4
__s^bu__and make it all scratch space .__c4
__s^aa__you know it's not a big deal .__c4
__fh__you're right about the backup being a bottleneck .__c5
__s^bk__right .__cb
__s__it's good to think towards scratch .__c5
__s__yeah | so these wouldn't be backed up the ==__cb
__qy.%-__yeah .__c5
__b__yep .__c8
__qy^rt__right .__cb
__s^e__so remind me afterward .__c4
__s^aa__and ==__cb
__s^aa__and i'll - and we'll look at your disk and see where to put stuff .__c4
__%--__okay all right .__c3
__s__i mean i could just u- - do a d. u on it | right ?__c3
__s^bk__and just see which - how much is on each .__c3
__s^bk__yep .__c4
__s__so ==__c3
__s__each partition .__c4
__s__and you want to use either x. a or scratch .__c4
__s.%--__okay .__c3
__s__well x.  question mark .__c4
__s__anything starting with x.  is scratch .__c4
__b__okay .__c3
__b__with two - two digits .__c5
__s:s__two digits | right .__c4
__s__x. a x. b x. c .__c4
__s__so @@ ==__c8
__s^bk__okay ?__c4
__s^bk__jane ?__c4
__%-__okay | so i got a little printout here .__c5
__s__so three on this side .__c5
__s__three on this side .__c5
__s^df.%--__and i stapled them .__c5
__s__okay .__c5
__s__all right | so first of all um there was a - an interest in the transcribe- - transcription uh checking procedures .__c5
__qy^rt__and - and i can tell you first uh to go through the steps .__c5
__s^nd__although you've probably seen them .__c5
__s^df.%--__um as you might imagine when you're dealing with um r- - really c- - a fair number of words and uh @@ natural speech ==__c5
__fh__which means s- - self repairs and all these other factors that there're lots of things to be um s- - standardized and streamlined and checked on .__c5
__s^ba^df__and um so ==__c5
__s^df__i did a bunch of checks .__c5
__s__and the first thing i did was obviously a spell check .__c5
__s^e__and at that point i discovered certain things .__c5
__s.%-__like um accommodate with one m.  .__c5
__s^aap__that kind of thing .__c5
__s^e__and then in addition to that i did an exhaustive listing of the forms in the data file .__c5
__s__which included n- - detecting things like f- - faulty punctuation and things .__c5
__s^am__i'm - i'm sorry to interrupt .__c2
__qy^d^g__yeah ?__c5
__s__you could - could i just back up a little bit ?__c2
__b__sure | please .__c5
__b__yeah | please please .__c5
__s.%-__and ==__c2
__s^bk|s^cs__yeah yeah yeah .__c5
__s^bk__so you're doing these - so the whole process is that the transcribers get the conversation .__c2
__s^bk__and they do their pass over it .__c2
__s__yes .__c5
__s__and then when they're finished with it it comes to you .__c2
__s.%--__and you begin these sanit- - these quality checks .__c2
__s__that's right .__c5
__s__exactly .__c5
__s__i do these checks .__c5
__qy^d^f^g^rt__uhhuh .__c5
__s__okay .__c2
__s^f|s__exactly .__c5
__s__okay .__c2
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__thank you .__c5
__qy^d^f^g^rt__and so uh i do a - an exhaustive listing of the forms ==__c5
__s^bd__actually i will go through this in - in order .__c5
__s__so if - if we could maybe wait and stick keep that for a second .__c5
__%--__because we're not ready for that .__c5
__s^df.%--__so on the fifth page seven down ==__c4
__s__yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly .__c5
__s__all right so | a spelling check first .__c5
__s.%-__then an exhaustive listing of the uh - all the forms in the data with the punctuation attached .__c5
__fg|%-__and at that point i pick up things like oh you know word followed by two commas .__c5
__s:s__and th- - and then another check involves uh being sure that every utterance has an identifiable speaker .__c5
__s__and if not then that gets checked .__c5
__s^bk|s__then there's this issue of glossing s- - w- - so-called spoken forms .__c5
__s^e__so there ==__c5
__s^aa__mo- - for the most part we're keeping it standard wo- - word level transcription .__c5
__s^aa__but there's ==__c5
__s^ba__w- - and that- - that's done with the assumption that pronunciation variants can be handled .__c5
__s^bk__so for things like and the fact that someone doesn't say the d.  uh that's not important enough to capture in the transcription .__c5
__s^rt__because a - a good pronunciation uh you know model would be able to handle that .__c5
__s.%--__however things like because where you're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable .__c5
__s^rt__and furthermore it's a form that's specific to spoken language .__c5
__s__those are r- - reasons - f- - for those reasons i - i kept that separate .__c5
__s.%--__and used the convention of using c. u. z for that form .__c5
__s^fa__however glossing it .__c5
__s^e__so that it's possible with the script to plug in the full orthographic form for that one .__c5
__s__and a couple of others .__c5
__s^rt__not many .__c5
__s__so want to is another one .__c5
__fh|s__going - uh going to is another one .__c5
__s__with just the assumption again that this - th- - these are things which it's not really fair to a- - c- - consider - expect that - a pronunciation model to handle .__c5
__s^rt__and chuck you in- - you indicated that because is - is one of those that's handled in a different way also | didn't you ?__c5
__s__did i ?==__c5
__s__i don't remember .__c2
__s^e__okay .__c5
__fg|s__so - so- - it might not have been - it might not have been you .__c5
__s^aa|s^na__huh .__c2
__s^bk.%__but someone told me that in fact because is treated differently in um i- - u- - in this context .__c5
__b__because of that r- - reason that um it's a little bit farther than a pronunciation variant .__c5
__s^rt__okay so after that ==__c5
__s__let's see .__c5
__qy^d^f^g^rt__um ==__c5
__s^rt__so that was part of the spell check or was that - that was after the spell check ?__c2
__s__well so when i get the exhau- ==__c5
__s__so the spell check picks up those words .__c5
__s^e__because they're not in the dictionary .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__b__so it gets because and want to and that ==__c5
__fh__and then you gloss them ?__c4
__s__yeah uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk__run it through ==__c5
__s__i have a sed - you know so i do sed script saying whenever you see going to you know convert it to going to you know gloss equals quote going to quote .__c5
__s__you know .__c5
__b__and with all these things being in curly brackets .__c5
__b__so they're always distinctive .__c5
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c4
__s^2.%--__okay | i also wrote a script which will um retrieve anything in curly brackets or anything which i've classified as an acronym .__c5
__s^ar__and a pronounced acronym .__c5
__s^rt__and the way i tag ac- - pronounced acronyms is that i have underscores between the components .__c5
__s__so if it's a. c. l then it's a.  underscore c.  underscore l.  .__c5
__s^bk|s__and the th- ==__c5
__s^bk__and so - so your list here are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings ?__c4
__s^bk__yes uhhuh yeah .__c5
__s__whew !__c4
__s__okay so now uh | and - a- ==__c5
__s^e__we are acronym loaded .__c4
__s^bk__um can i ask a question about the glossing uh before we go on ?__cb
__s__yeah .__c5
__fh|s__so for a word like because is it that it's always predictably because ?__cb
__s^e__i mean is c. u. z always meaning because ?__cb
__s^e__yes | but not the reverse .__c5
__s.%--__so sometimes people will say because in the meeting .__c5
__s^rt__and if - if they actually said because then it's written as because with no - w- ==__c5
__s__because doesn't even figure into the equation .__c5
__s^2__beca- - because ==__cb
__b__but - but in our meetings people don't say hey because how you doing .__c8
__b__right right .__cb
__s.%-__except right there .__c4
__s^m^na__yeah .__c5
__s^2__yeah .__c8
__s^bk__um so i guess - so from the point of view of ==__cb
__s__that's a good point .__c5
__%-__the - the only problem is that with - for the recognition we - we map it to because .__cb
__s.%--__and so if we know that c. u. z ==__cb
__s__well ==__c4
__s^df__that's fine .__c5
__s^df^e__well don has a script .__c5
__s^df__but they have the gloss .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^e__but we don't ==__cb
__s__you have the gloss form .__c4
__s__so you always replace it .__c4
__s^bk__exactly .__c5
__s__if that's how - what you want to do .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s^df__and don knows this .__c5
__s__and he's bee- - he has a glo- - he has a script that ==__c5
__s^e__yeah .__c3
__qy^bu^d__i replace the because with because if it's glossed .__c3
__qy__s- ==__cb
__s^aa__right .__cb
__h__but if it's ==__cb
__%--__okay .__cb
__s.%--__but then there are other glosses that we don't replace | right ?__cb
__s__and ==__c3
__s__because ==__cb
__s__yes | and that's why there're different tags on the glosses .__c5
__s__okay | so then it's fine .__cb
__s__on the different - on the different types of comments .__c5
__s__which we'll - which we'll see in just a second .__c5
__s^aa|s^na__right .__c3
__b__okay .__cb
__b__so the pronounceable acronyms get underscores .__c5
__s.%--__the things in curly brackets are viewed as comments .__c5
__fh__there're comments of four types .__c5
__s^e__so this is a good time to introduce that .__c5
__s^e__the four types .__c5
__fg|s__w- - and maybe we'll expand that .__c5
__s^aa__um ==__c4
__s^aap|s.%--__but the - but the comments are um of four types mainly right now .__c5
__s^bk__one of them is um the gloss type we just mentioned .__c5
__fh|s__can - ca- ==__c4
__s:s|qh^cs__another type is um ==__c5
__s:s^df__so | a- - are we done with acronyms ?__c4
__s:s^e__because i had a question on what - what this meant .__c4
__s__i'm still doing the overview .__c5
__s__i haven't actually gotten here yet .__c5
__s^df__oh i'm sorry .__c4
__s__okay | so gloss is things like replacing the full form u- - with the um more abbreviated one to the left .__c5
__s__uh then you have if it's - uh there're a couple different types of elements that can happen that aren't really properly words .__c5
__s__and wo- - some of them are laughs and breathes .__c5
__s.%--__so we have - uh that's prepended with a v- - a tag of v. o. c .__c5
__s__whew .__c1
__s__@@ .__c1
__s^df__and the non vocal ones are like door-slams and tappings .__c5
__b__and that's prepended with a no- - non-vocalization .__c5
__s__so then it - just an ending curly brace there ?__c2
__s__or is there something else in there ?__c2
__fh__oh yeah | so i- - e- - this would ==__c5
__fh__let's just take one example .__c5
__s__a comment basically .__c4
__s__oh oh oh .__c2
__s__and then the no- - non-vocalization would be something like a door slam .__c5
__s^bd__they always end .__c5
__s^df__so it's like they're paired curly brackets .__c5
__s__and then the third type right now uh is m- - things that fall in the category of comments about what's happening .__c5
__s.%--__so it could be something like you know referring to so-and-so .__c5
__fh__talking about such and such .__c5
__s.%--__uh you know looking at so-and-so .__c5
__s__so on the m- ==__c2
__s__on the middle t- - so in the first case that gloss applies to the word to the left .__c2
__s__yeah .__c5
__s^ba|qy^d^f__yeah | and this gets substituted here .__c5
__s^aa|s^na__but in the middle two th- - it's not applying to anything | right ?__c2
__s.%--__they're impulsive .__c4
__b__huh uh .__c5
__s__okay .__c2
__s__no | they're events .__c5
__s.%-__they're actually - they have the status of events .__c5
__s^e__okay .__c2
__s^bk^rt|s__well the qual can be - the qual is applying to the left .__c4
__b__right | i just meant the middle two ones .__c2
__s^f|s^bsc__yep .__c4
__s^bc__yeah .__c2
__s^bk|s__well and actually um it is true that with respect to laugh there's another one .__c5
__s^r__which is while laughing .__c5
__s.%-__while laughing .__c4
__s__and that is uh i- - i- - an argument could be made for this tur- - turning that into a qualitative statement .__c5
__s^e__because it's talking about the thing that preceded it .__c5
__s^bk__but at present we haven't been um uh coding the exact scope of laughing | you know .__c5
__s^e__and so to have while laughing you know that it happened somewhere in there .__c5
__s__which could well mean that it occurred separately and following .__c5
__s__or you know including some of the utterances to the left .__c5
__s^bk|s^j__haven't been awfully precise about that .__c5
__s^cc^j__but i have here ==__c5
__s^j|qy^d^f^g__now we're about to get to the - to this now .__c5
__s^na__i have frequencies .__c5
__s^bk|s^co^tc__so you'll see how often these different things occur .__c5
__s__but um uh | the very front page deals with this uh final c- - pa- - uh uh aspect of the standardization .__c5
__s^bk__which has to do with the spoken forms like uhhuh and uhhuh and ha and uhuh and all these different types .__c5
__s__and um uh someone pointed out to me .__c5
__fh|s.%--__this might have been chuck about um - about how a recognizer if it's looking for uhhuh with three m. 's and it's transcribed with two m. 's that it might - uh that it might increase the error rate .__c5
__s__which is - which would really be a shame .__c5
__s^df__because um i p- - i personally w- - would not be able to make a claim that those are dr- - dramatically different items .__c5
__s.%--__so right now i've standardized across all the existing data with these spoken forms .__c5
__s^fa__oh good .__c4
__s^bk__i - i should say ==__c5
__s^co^t1__so it's a small list .__c4
__s__all existing data except thirty minutes which got found today .__c5
__s__so i'm going to - i'm going to - i'm going to check ==__c5
__s__that - that's known as found data .__c4
__s__yeah yeah .__c5
__s.%--__acsu- - actually yeah .__c5
__s__i got - it was stored in a place i didn't expect .__c5
__s^e|qy^d^f^g__it's like the z- - zapruder film .__c3
__s__so - and - and um ==__c5
__s^e__w- - we uh sh- - yea- - reconstructed how that happened .__c5
__s^df__i want to work with lost data .__c8
__s^cs__yeah | it's much easier .__c4
__s^e__and this is - this'll be great .__c5
__s^bk__so i'll - i'll be able to get through that tonight .__c5
__b__and then everyth- - i- - well actually later today probably .__c5
__s^bk__huh .__c4
__s__and so then we'll have everything following these conventions .__c5
__fh__but you notice it's really rather a small set of these kinds of things .__c5
__qh__yeah .__c4
__qh__and i made it so that these are um with a couple exceptions but things that you wouldn't find in the spell checker .__c5
__qh__so that they'll show up really easily .__c5
__s^e__and um ==__c5
__qh__jane can i ask you a question ?__c3
__s^df__what's that very last one correspond to ?__c3
__qh__sure .__c5
__s__i don't even know how to pronounce that .__c3
__s^rt__well yeah | now that - that s- - only occurs once .__c5
__s__yeah .__cb
__s__and i'm thinking of changing that .__c5
__s^df__right .__cb
__s^bd__so- - c- - i haven't listened to it .__c5
__s__uh is that like someone's like burning or some such thing ?__c3
__s__so i don't know .__c5
__s^t^tc__i haven't heard it actually .__c5
__fh__like their hair's on fire .__c3
__b__i n- - i need to listen to that one .__c5
__s^bk__uh !__c4
__s^ft__actually we - we gave this to our pronunciation person .__cb
__qo^rt__it's the castle of uh .__c1
__s^fw__uh it looks like that .__c3
__s^cs__she's like i don't know what that is either .__cb
__s__so ==__cb
__s^df__did she hear the th- - did she actually hear it ?__c5
__b__no | we just gave her a list of words that you know weren't in our dictionary .__cb
__s__because i haven't heard it .__c5
__s__and so of course it picked up stuff like this .__cb
__qr__and she just didn't listen .__cb
__h|s^nd__so she didn't know .__cb
__s^bk__we just - we're waiting on that just to do the alignments .__cb
__s^rt__yeah .__c5
__s__yeah | i'm curious to se- - hear what it is .__c5
__s__but i didn't know - want to change it to something else until i knew .__c5
__fh|s__maybe it's argh .__cb
__s|s^bk__right .__c3
__s.%--__@@ .__cb
__s__well sss you know ==__c5
__b__but that's not really like ==__c3
__fh|s__hhh .__c5
__s^bk__yeah .__cb
__s^ft__@@ .__c5
__fg__no one really says argh | you know .__c3
__s^ft__right | no one say- ==__cb
__s^fw__well you just did .__c8
__s__it's not ==__c3
__qy^t3__well ==__c3
__s^co^t3__yeah .__c5
__s^bk^t3__@@ .__c4
__fg|s^ar^t3__there's another - there's another word error .__c3
__s^co^t3__except for now .__c2
__s^bk^t3|s^fa^t3__that's right .__c5
__s.%--__yes | that's right .__c4
__s__we're going to have a big problem when we talk about that .__c4
__s^bk__cha-ching !__c3
__s__uh .__cb
__%-__we're going to never recognize this meeting .__c2
__s.%-__okay .__c5
__s__in monty python you say argh a lot .__c4
__s__oh yeah ?__c3
__s^ft__so ==__c4
__s^bk__well or if you're a c.  programmer .__c4
__s^r__huh .__c3
__s^cs.%--__yeah | that's right .__c5
__s^ba__yeah .__c8
__fh__you say arg c. and arg v. all the time .__c4
__s^na__that's right .__c5
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah .__c8
__b.%__that's true .__c3
__s^bk__but it has a different prosody .__cb
__s^aa__yeah .__c5
__s^ft__arg .__c8
__s__it does .__c4
__h|s^tc__arg - arg-max arg-min .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__yeah .__c8
__s__uh !__c4
__s^cs__uh ==__c5
__fh__so | jane what's the - d- ==__cb
__s__maybe he died while dictating .__c4
__s__so ==__c5
__s__i have one question about the - the e. h versus like the a. h and the u. h .__cb
__s__that's partly a nonnative-native thing .__c5
__fh__@@ .__cb
__fh__but i have found e. h in native speakers too .__c5
__s__okay .__cb
__s__but it's mostly non native .__c5
__s__s- - okay .__cb
__s__h.  ==__c1
__s^e__that's uh versus uh ?__c2
__s__uh .__c5
__s^e__uh .__c4
__s__uh | yeah right .__cb
__s__because there were - were some speakers that did definite uh's .__cb
__s^e__uhhuh .__c5
__s__but right now we ==__cb
__s__they were the canadians | right ?__c2
__s^e__canadians | yeah yeah yeah .__c8
__s^df.%--__that's right .__c5
__s__so it - it's actually probably good for us to know the difference between the real uh and the one that's just like uh or transcribed ah .__cb
__s^df__exactly .__c5
__s__because in - like in switchboard you would see e- - all of these forms .__cb
__s__but they all were like uh .__cb
__s__you mean just the single letter a as in the particle ?__c4
__s^bsc__the transcription or ==__c1
__s^e__no no | i mean like the - the u. h .__cb
__s__article .__c4
__s__u. h .__c5
__s__oh .__c4
__s__or - the u. h e. h a. h were all the same .__cb
__s^cs__and then we have this additional non native version of uh like eeh .__cb
__s__all the e. h s i've seen have been like that .__c3
__s^e__they've been like uh ==__c3
__s__like that have bee- - has been transcribed to e. h .__c3
__s__uhhuh | that's right .__c5
__s^cs__and sometimes it's stronger .__c3
__s^df__like eeh which is like closer to e. h .__c3
__s__huh .__c5
__s^e__right .__cb
__s^f__but ==__c3
__s__yeah .__c5
__fh__i'm just - these poor transcribers they're going to hate this meeting .__c4
__s__i know .__c3
__s^cs__we should go off line .__c3
__s^e__well we're not doing - we're not doing length .__c5
__s^e__quick thilo do a - do a filled pause for us .__c8
__s^e__yeah | that's right .__c5
__s^df__ooo no .__c1
__s__but you're a native german speaker .__cb
__s__so it's not a - not a issue for ==__cb
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^rt__it's only ==__cb
__s__@@ them canadians .__c4
__s__onl- ==__cb
__b__yeah .__cb
__s^df__no | only if you don't have lax vowels i guess .__cb
__s:s__right ?__cb
__s__so it's - like japanese and spanish .__cb
__s__oh .__c4
__s^cs__this makes sense .__c5
__s^bd__yeah | i - i think you've ==__c5
__s^df__uhhuh yeah .__c5
__s__and ==__cb
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c8
__s^bu__oh i see .__c4
__s^bk|s^df__that makes sense .__c5
__h__i didn't get that .__c4
__s^bk__okay .__c4
__s__yeah and so | you know i mean th- - th- - i have - there are some um americans who - who are using this uh too .__c5
__s^bk__and i haven't listened to it systematically .__c5
__s^e.%--__maybe with some of them uh they'd end up being uh's .__c5
__s^bk|s^cs^rt__but uh i- - my spot checking has made me think that we do have uh in also um american e- - e- - data represented here .__c5
__s^df__but ==__c5
__s^bk^rt__any case that's the - this is reduced down from really quite a long- - a much longer list .__c5
__s__yeah | this is great .__cb
__s.%--__and this is ==__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk__yeah | it's good .__c4
__s__this is really really helpful .__cb
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__functionally pretty you know also ==__c5
__qy^d^f^g__it was fascinating i was listening to some of these uh i guess two nights ago .__c5
__s__and it's just hilarious to liste- - to - to do a search for the uhhuh's .__c5
__s.%-__and you get uhhuh .__c5
__qy^bu^d^rt__and diff- - everybody's doing it .__c5
__qrr.%--__and just listen to them .__c4
__s^na__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__just - i wanted to say - i w- - think it would be fun to make a montage of it .__c5
__qy^d^f^g^rt__because there's a uhhuh .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c5
__s__performance art .__c4
__s__just extract them all .__c4
__s__right .__cb
__s__it's really - it's really fun to listen to .__c5
__s__morgan can make a song out of it .__c2
__fh|s.%--__all these different vocal tracts you know .__c5
__s^bk__but it's - it's the same item .__c5
__s^df__it's very interesting .__c5
__s__okay .__c5
__s__uh then the acronyms .__c5
__s^bk^m__y- - and the ones in parentheses are ones which the transcriber wasn't sure of .__c5
__s__and i haven't been able to listen to to - to clarify .__c5
__s^e__oh i see .__c4
__s__but you can see that the parenthesis convention makes it very easy to find them .__c5
__b__o- ==__c4
__s.%-__because it's the only place where - where they're used .__c5
__qw^rt__how about question mark ?__c4
__s.%--__the question marks | yeah .__c1
__s^r__question mark is punctuation .__c5
__s^r__what are those ?__c1
__s__so it - they said that @@ .__c5
__s^nd|s__oh .__c4
__s^e__uhhuh .__c3
__s__um d. c .__c5
__s__so they - so it's p. l. p .__c4
__s^r__uh .__c1
__s^bk|s__exactly .__c5
__s^ar__exactly .__c5
__s__yeah | so the only ==__c5
__s^nd__well and i do have a stress marker here .__c5
__%--__sometimes the contrastive stress is showing up .__c5
__s__and um ==__c5
__s__i'm sorry i - i got lost here .__c8
__qy^bu^d^rt__what- - w- - what's the difference between the parenthesized acronym and the non-parenthesized ?__c8
__s^ar__the parenthesized is something that the transcriber thought was a. n. n but wasn't entirely sure .__c5
__s^no__so i'd need to go back or someone needs to go back and say you know yes or no .__c5
__s^cs.%--__uh .__c8
__s^no__right .__cb
__s^bk__and then get rid of the parentheses .__c5
__s__but the parentheses are used only in that context in the transcripts of - of noti- - noticing that there's something uncertain .__c5
__s__yeah p. make is ==__c4
__s__yeah i mean because they - they have no idea .__cb
__s__that's a good one .__c4
__s^df__that's correct .__c4
__s^df__right .__cb
__s__if you hear c. t. p. d i mean they do pretty well .__cb
__s^e__yeah .__c8
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__b__but it's ==__cb
__fh__i - i don't recognize a lot of these .__c8
__s__you know how are - how are they going to know ?__cb
__qw__i know .__c4
__qw^br^rt__i ==__c8
__qw^r__i - i was saying that i think a lot of them are the networks meeting .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__qw__i think that's true .__c5
__s__maybe .__c8
__s^bk__yeah absolutely .__c5
__s__yeah .__cb
__s^cc__n. s. a .__c5
__s__i see a few .__c4
__s^fa__a lot of these are - are coming from them .__c5
__s^cs__i listened to some of that .__c5
__fh__although i see - i see plenty of uh ==__c4
__s__yeah | we don't have that many acronyms comparatively in this meeting .__c3
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__yeah | i agree .__c5
__s__it's not so bad .__c3
__fh|s__right .__cb
__s__and robustness has a fair amount .__c5
__s__but the n. s. a group is just very very many .__c5
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^e__huh .__c3
__s__the recognizer it is funny .__cb
__s__kept getting p. t. a for p. d. a .__cb
__s__this is close .__cb
__s^e__yeah .__c8
__s__yeah that's pretty close .__c4
__s__right .__cb
__s__and the p. t. a was in these uh topics about children .__cb
__s__that's not bad .__c3
__s^e__yeah .__c5
__s__so anyway ==__cb
__s__that's interesting .__c5
__s__is the p.  - p. t. a working .__cb
__s^bk^rt__right | and sometimes i mean you see a couple of these that are actually okay's .__c5
__s^ft__so it's - it's - may be that they got to the point where - i mean it was low enough understandable ==__c5
__s__understandability that they weren't entirely sure the person said okay .__c5
__s^bk|%-__you know so it isn't really necessarily a - an undecipherable acronym .__c5
____but just n- - needs to be double checked .__c5
__z__there's a lot of okay's .__c3
____now we get to the comments .__c5
____the number to the left is the number of incidences ?__c8
____this ==__c5
____count .__c4
__s^bk|s^ft__number of times out of the entire database .__c5
__s^cs__yep .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__fh__w- - except for that last thirty minutes i haven't checked yet .__c5
__s__so c. t. s is really big here .__c8
__s__yeah | i wonder what it is .__c4
