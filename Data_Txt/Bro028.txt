__s__what things to talk about .__c1
__s__i'm - what ?__c5
__s^e__really ?__c5
__b__oh that's horrible !__c5
__s__disincentive !__c5
__fh__okay we're recording .__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__hello ?__c5
__qw^e__check check check check .__c1
__h|s__hello ?__c5
__s^rt__uh yeah .__c3
__s^bk__which am i ?__c5
__s^ba|s__oh right .__c2
__b__all right good .__c1
__fh__channel fi- - okay .__c5
__s^ba__okay .__c5
__fg__are you doing something ?__c5
__fg|s^cs^t^tc__okay | then i guess i'm doing something .__c5
__b.x__so um ==__c5
__qy^bu^d|qy^d^g__so basically the result of m- - much thinking since the last time we met um but not as much writing um is a sheet that i have a lot of like thoughts and justification of comments on .__c5
__s^aa__but i'll just pass out as is right now .__c5
__s^bk__so um ==__c5
__fh__here .__c5
__fg|s^rt__if you could pass this around .__c5
__fh__and there's two things .__c5
__s__and so one on one side is - on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification .__c5
__s^rt__um ==__c3
__s^ar|qy^bu^d^rt__and the other side is um sort of a revised construction formalism .__c5
__s^aa|s__the ==__c3
__qrr.%-__wait .__c3
__s__this is just one sheet | right ?__c4
__s^bk__uh .__c3
__s__it's just one sheet .__c5
__s__just one sheet .__c3
__s__it's just a - nothing else .__c5
__s^e^rt__okay .__c3
__fh__front back .__c3
__s^e__um ==__c5
__s^e__enough to go around ?__c5
__fh__okay .__c5
__qw__and in some ways it's - it's - it's very similar to ==__c5
__s__there are very few changes in some ways from what we've um uh b- - done before .__c5
__b__but i don't think everyone here has seen all of this .__c5
__s^ba__so uh i'm not sure where to begin .__c5
__s^bu^m__um as usual the disclaimers are there are - all these things are ==__c5
__s^aa__it's only slightly more stable than it was before .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__%-__and um after a little bit more discussion and especially like keith and i - i have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days um it'll probably change again some more .__c5
__s^bu__yeah .__c4
__s^aa|%-__um maybe i will ==__c5
__s^aa__let's start b- - let's start on number two actually on the notation .__c5
__s^ba__um because that's ==__c5
__s^bk__i'm thinking possibly a little more familiar to um - to people .__c5
__fh__okay so the top block is just sort of a - sort of abstract nota- ==__c5
__s^bu__it's sort of like um listings of the kinds of things that we can have .__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__and certain things that have um - changed have changed back to this .__c5
__s^aa__there - there's been a little bit of um going back and forth .__c5
__s^aa|s^na__but basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name .__c5
__s^cs__i forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line .__c5
__s^aa__what i was going to ==__c2
__%-__so something like um ==__c5
__s^aa__right .__c2
__s^cs__well there's an example .__c5
__s^aa__the textual example at the end has clausal construction .__c5
__b__so ==__c5
__fh__um just to show it doesn't have to be beautiful latex .__c5
__qy__it could be you know simple old text as well .__c5
__s^aa__um there are a couple of ==__c5
__s^bk__uh these three have various ways of doing certain things .__c5
__s__so i'll just try to go through them .__c5
__x__so they could all have a type at the beginning .__c5
__%--__um and then they say the key word construction .__c5
__b__oh i see .__c2
__fh__and they have some name .__c5
__s^bk.%__so - so the current syntax is if it s- - if there's a type it's before construct- ==__c2
__fh__yeah right .__c5
__fg|s^rt^t^tc__okay | that's fine .__c2
__s__okay | and then it has a block that is constituents .__c5
__s.%--__and as usual i guess all the constructions her- - all the examples here have only um - tsk one type of constituent .__c5
__s__that is a constructional constituent .__c5
__s^bd__i think that's actually going to turn out to m- - be certainly the most common kind .__c5
__s^df__but in general instead of the word construct th- - here you might have meaning or form as well .__c5
__s__okay ?__c5
__qy^bu^d^rt__so if there's some element that doesn't - that isn't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning .__c5
__s^aa__okay .__c5
__s^bk__um | the main change with the constructs which - each of which has um the key word construct and then some name and then some type specification is that it's ==__c5
__qy__it's pro- - it's often - sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is .__c5
__s^ar|s^nd__so for example whatever i have here is going to be a form of the word throw .__c5
__s^e.%-__or it's going to be a form of the word you know i don't know happy or something like that .__c5
__s^bk__or you know some- - it'll be a specific word .__c5
__s^aa^m__or maybe you'll have the type .__c5
__s^bk__you'll say i need a p- - uh spatial relation phrase here .__c5
__s__or i need a directional specifier here .__c5
__b__so- - uh you could have a j- - a actual type here .__c5
__b__um or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type .__c5
__s__so a very common example of this is that you know in directed motion the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind .__c5
__b__often a human .__c5
__fh__right ?__c5
__s^no__so if i you know the- - um - uh run down the street then i ==__c5
__s__i - i run down the street .__c5
__s__it's typed uh i .__c5
__fh__meaning category is what's there .__c5
__qw.%-__the - the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair .__c5
__s^no__and um ==__c5
__fh__sort of skipping fonts and whatever .__c5
__s^cc__the idea is that sometimes there are um general constructions that you know that you're going to need .__c5
__s^bk|s^na__it's - it's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase or something like that there .__c5
__s^df__uhhuh .__c4
__s^am^cs__and usually it has formal um considerations that will go along with it .__c5
__s^ba__uhhuh .__c2
__b__and then uh you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you're talking about .__c5
__s__about what meaning - what specific meaning you want .__c5
__s^bk__so the example again at the bottom which is directed motion .__c5
__s^bu__you might need a nominal expression to take the place of you know um - the big th- - you- - you know the big - the tall dark man you know walked into the room .__c5
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__but because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it's nominal of some kind .__c5
__s^bk__but in particular that it's some kind of animate nominal .__c5
__b__and which will apply just as well to like you know a per- - you know a simple proper noun .__c5
__qy^bu^d.%--__or to some complicated expression .__c5
__s.%--__um ==__c5
__s__so i don't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types .__c5
__s^bk|s^rt__so ==__c5
__fh__okay | then i don't think the um ==__c5
__s__at least ==__c5
__s__yeah | none of these examples have anything different for formal constraints .__c5
__fh__but you can refer to any of the um sort of available elements and scope .__c5
__s^rt__right | which here are the constructs to say something about the relation .__c5
__s__and i think i- - if you not- - if you compare like the top block and the textual block um we dropped like the little f.  subscript .__c5
__b__the f.  subscripts refer to the form piece of the construct .__c5
__fh__good .__c2
__s__and i think that um in general it'll be unambiguous .__c5
__s^rt__like if you were giving a formal constraint then you're referring to the formal pole of that .__c5
__b__so - so by saying if i just said name one then that means name one formal .__c5
__fh__and we're talking about formal struc- - which - which makes sense .__c5
__fg|s.%-__uh there are certain times when we'll have an exception to that .__c5
__qy.%--__in which case you could just indicate here i mean the meaningful for some reason .__c5
__s^fa__right .__c5
__qy__or - actually it's more often that only to handle this one special case of you know george and jerry walk into the room in that order .__c5
__s^bk__so we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form .__c5
__%-__uhhuh .__c4
__s^aa__but - but s- - we're not going to really worry about that for right now .__c5
__s^df.%-__and there are way- - we can be more specific if we have to later on .__c5
__s__okay | and so in terms of the - the relations .__c5
__b__you know as usual they're before and ends .__c5
__b__i should have put an example in of something that isn't an interval relation .__c5
__s__but in form you might also have a value binding .__c5
__b__you know you could say that um - you know name one dot t- - you know number equals you know a plural or something like that .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s^bk__there are certain things that are attribute value similar to the bindings below .__c5
__fh__but i mean they're just - us- - usually they're going to be value - value fillers | right ?__c5
__qy^bu^d.%-__okay | and then again semantic constraints here are just - are just bindings .__c5
__s__there was talk of changing the name of that .__c5
__%--__and johno and i - i - you - you and i can like fight about that if you like .__c5
__fh__but about changing it to semantic n- - effects .__c5
__s^rt__which i thought was a little bit too order biased .__c5
__s__well ==__c1
__fh__th- ==__c1
__s__and semantic bindings .__c5
__s^df__which i thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only bindings .__c5
__s^bk__and so it was an issue whether constraints - um there were some linguists who reacted against constraints saying oh if it's not used for matching then it shouldn't be called a constraint .__c5
__fh.%__but i think we want to be uncommitted about whether it's used for matching or not | right ?__c5
__fh__because there are - i think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the c- - bindings are for .__c5
__s^ba__actual you know sort of like modified constraining purposes .__c5
__%-__well you definitely want to de couple the formalism from the parsing strategy .__c2
__s^aa|%--__yeah .__c4
__%--__so that whether or not it's used for matching or only for verification i ==__c2
__s^ba.%__yeah yeah .__c5
__s^am^cs__it's used shouldn't matter | right .__c5
__%-__uhhuh .__c5
__qh^d^rt__s- - for sure .__c2
__%--__uhhuh .__c5
__fh__i mean i don't know what uh term we want to use .__c2
__s^ba__but we don't want to ==__c2
__fh__yeah | uh there was one time when - when hans explained why constraints was a misleading word for him .__c5
__b__yep .__c2
__fh__and i think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why johno thought it was a misleading term .__c5
__s__which was just an interesting coincidence .__c5
__s^bk|s__um but uh ==__c5
__b__and so i was like okay | well both of you don't like it .__c5
__fh__fine | we can change it .__c5
__b.%__it's g- - it's gone .__c2
__s__but i - i - i'm starting to like it again .__c5
__b__so that- - that's why - that's why i'll stick with it .__c5
__fh__but ==__c1
__s__so ==__c5
__s__well you know what ?__c0
__b__if you have an if then phrase do you know what the then phrase is called ?__c0
__fh__th- ==__c2
__fg|s__what ?__c5
__fh__con- - uh a consequent ?__c5
__s__yeah .__c0
__qy^d^f^g__yeah | but it's not an if then .__c5
__s^df__i know .__c2
__b__anyway | so the other - the other strategy you guys could consider is when you don't know what word to put you could put no word .__c2
__s^e__no | but ==__c0
__fh__uhhuh .__c5
__s__just meaning .__c2
__b__okay ?__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__s.%--__and the- - then let ==__c2
__s__yeah | that's true .__c5
__s__so that's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down - down here ?__c1
__s__oh | oops !__c5
__s^am__no | that was just a mistake of cut and paste from when i was going with it .__c5
__s^bk__okay .__c1
__fh|s.%-__okay .__c2
__fg__so i'm sorry .__c5
__s__i didn't mean - that one's an in- - unintentional .__c5
__b__so this should be semantic and ==__c1
__s__sometimes i'm intentionally inconsistent .__c5
__b__@@ .__c1
__b__because i'm not sure yet .__c5
__s^bk__here i actually - it was just a mistake .__c5
__fh__th- - so this definitely should be semantic constraints down at the bottom .__c1
__s__sure .__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__s^df__okay .__c1
__b__well unless i go with meaning .__c5
__s^ba__but i- - i mean i kind of like meaning better than semantic .__c5
__b.%__or ==__c1
__fh|s^bd__oh whatever .__c2
__fh|s^df__but i think there's vestiges of other people's biases .__c5
__s__or - wh- ==__c2
__s__like ==__c5
__s__that- - b- ==__c2
__s__right .__c2
__b.%__minor - min- - problem .__c2
__s__minor point .__c5
__s__extremely .__c4
__s__okay .__c2
__fh__okay um ==__c5
__s^rt__so i think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information ex- - than the top block .__c5
__fh__and the bottom block similarly only just illus- - you know all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and - and that you can drop the um - uh that you can give dual types .__c5
__s__oh one thing i should mention is about designates .__c5
__s__i think i'm actually inconsistent across these as well .__c5
__s__so um strike out the m.  subscript on the middle block .__c5
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c2
__fh__so basically now um this is actually this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change .__c5
__qy^bu^d^rt__which is that designates isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now .__c5
__h|s^aa__good .__c2
__s^e__so we want s- - designates to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects .__c5
__fh|s__but is sort of um really important for say composition later on .__c5
__s__so for instance if some other construction says you know are you of type - is this part of type whatever um the designates tells you which sort of part is the meaning part .__c5
__qw__okay so if you have like the big red ball you know you want to know if there's an object or a noun .__c5
__s__well ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase .__c5
__s^e__huh .__c4
__s^bk|s^cs__um ==__c5
__b__there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it's useful sometimes to talk about um to talk about there also being a designated object .__c5
__b__and we think that that'll be the same one | right .__c5
__b__so the ball is the head of the phrase .__c5
__b__the r- - the - um big red ball .__c5
__s^bk__and the entity denoted by the word ball is sort of the semantic head in some ways of - of this sort of um - in- - interesting larger element .__c5
__fh__a- - a- - and the ==__c2
__fg|s__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__and there's - uh there's ca- - some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__and - and this enables you to get that if i understand you right .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__fh__right right .__c5
__s__that's the idea .__c4
__fg|s^cs__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__yeah yeah .__c2
__s^e__and uh you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head final language you can refer to the head as a p- - the you know - the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision .__c5
__s__right .__c2
__b__so that's a useful thing .__c5
__s__so that you can get some internal structural constraints in .__c5
__s.%--__okay | so that all looks good .__c2
__b__let me ==__c2
__s__oh w- - oh ==__c2
__b__i don't know .__c2
__s^ba__were you finished ?__c2
__fh__um | there was a list of things that isn't included .__c5
__fg|s^t^tc__but you - you can - you can ask a question .__c5
__s^bd^df__that might @@ it .__c5
__%--__okay .__c2
__fh__so i- - if i understand this - the ==__c2
__s__aside from uh construed and all that sort of stuff the - the differences are mainly that we've gone to the possibility of having form meaning pairs for a type .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__fh__or actually gone back to .__c2
__s^bu__right .__c5
__s^bu^e__if we go back far enough ==__c2
__s^aa|s.%-__well except for their construction meaning .__c5
__s^2__so it's not clear that ==__c5
__b__uh ==__c5
__s^bd__well right now it's a c- - uh contr- - construction type and meaning type .__c5
__s^bd^e__so i don't know what a form type is .__c5
__s^aa__oh i see .__c2
__s^ba__yeah yeah yeah .__c2
__fh__i'm sorry .__c2
__s^df__yeah .__c5
__b__you're right .__c2
__s^df^e__a construction type .__c2
__fh|s.%--__uh that's fine .__c2
__s.%--__right .__c5
__b__but it um ==__c2
__fh__a- - well and a previous um you know version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it .__c5
__s__so you could say construct of type whatever designates something .__c5
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__but that was mostly for reference purposes .__c5
__s__just to refer to the meaning pole .__c5
__s.%--__i don't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const- - type constraint on the meaning .__c5
__s.%--__which is really what we want most of the time i think .__c5
__%-__uhhuh .__c2
__s__um ==__c5
__s__i - i don't know if we'll ever have a case where we actually h- ==__c5
__b__if there is a form category constraint you could imagine having a triple there that says you know - that's kind of weird .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__no no no | i don't think so .__c2
__s^e__i think that you'll - you'll do fine .__c2
__s^e__i ==__c4
__s^df^e__in fact these are um ==__c2
__fh__as long as - as mark isn't around these are form constraints .__c2
__s__so a nominal expression is - uh the fact that it's animate is semantic .__c2
__qh^cs__the fact that it's n- - uh a nominal expression i would say on most people's notion of - of f- - you know higher form types this i- - this is one .__c2
__qy^d^f^g__uhhuh .__c5
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__right right .__c5
__qh__yeah yeah .__c4
__h__and i think that's just fine .__c2
__s__which is fine | yeah .__c5
__s__it's - that now um i'm mentioned this .__c4
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__i - i don't know if i ever explained this .__c4
__s^ba__but the point of um ==__c4
__s^aap|%-__i mentioned in the last meeting the point of having something called nominal expression is um ==__c4
__fh__because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for you know like say taking as its object just some expression which um designates an object or designates a thing or whatever um - that leads to some syntactic problems basically .__c4
__s:s^ba__so you want to you know - you sort of have this problem like okay well i'll put the word uh let's say the word dog .__c4
__qy^d^f__you know | and that has to come right after the verb .__c4
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c5
__s^no__because we know verb meets its object .__c4
__%-__and then we have a construction that says oh you can have the preceding a noun .__c4
__fg|s__and so you'd have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet the designatum .__c4
__s^df.%--__right .__c2
__s__and you could get you know the kicked dog or something like that meaning kicked the dog .__c4
__s__right .__c2
__fh__um so you kind of have to let this phrase idea in there .__c4
__s^nd.%--__but ==__c4
__%-__that i - i have no problem with it at all .__c2
__qh.%-__it- - it- ==__c4
__s^bk^m|s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s^df.%-__yeah .__c5
__qh^cs__i think it's fine .__c2
__qw^br^d^m__right | n- - s- ==__c5
__s__you may be - you may not be like everyone else in - in berkeley .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__yeah .__c4
__s^ba__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__but that's okay .__c5
__b__i mean we - we - we sort of thought we were getting away with uh - with a p- ==__c4
__s__uh we don't mind either .__c5
__b__so ==__c5
__%--__i mean this is not reverting to the x. bar theory of - of phrase structure .__c4
__fh__right .__c2
__b.%__but uh ==__c4
__s^t1__right .__c5
__qw^t1.%-__i just know that this is - like we didn't originally have in mind that uh - that verbs would subcategorize for a particular sort of form .__c4
__s^df__uhhuh .__c5
__%-__but they do .__c2
__s^ar|s^nd__um ==__c4
__s^df__but they does .__c4
__s^aap|qh^df__well there's an alternative to this .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__at least in english .__c4
__s^bd^no__which is um - the question was did we want directed motion ==__c5
__%-__yeah .__c2
__b__which is an argument structure construction ==__c5
__s^df^ng__yeah .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c2
__qy^cs^rt__did we want it to worry about um anything more than the fact that it you know has semantic ?==__c5
__s__you know it's sort of frame based construction .__c5
__s^aa|s__so one option that you know keith had mentioned also was like well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject predicate basically things like grammatical relations .__c5
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s__those could intersect with these .__c5
__s^bk__in such a way that subject predicate or subject predicate subject verb ob- - you know verb object would require that those things that f- - fill a subject and object are nom expressions .__c5
__b__right .__c2
__s^e__and that would be a little bit cleaner in some way .__c5
__s^bk__but you know for now i mean ==__c5
__s^bu__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__but it - y- - y- - it's - yeah just moving it - moving the c- - the cons- - the constraints around .__c2
__s__uh you know .__c5
__s^aa__m- - moving it to another place | right .__c5
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__s__okay | so that's ==__c2
__s__but there does - basically the point is there has to be that constraint somewhere | right ?__c5
__b__right .__c2
__fh__so ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__b__and so that was the ==__c2
__s__robert's not happy now ?__c5
__s^bs__no .__c0
__s^e__oh okay .__c5
__b__okay | and sort of going with that is that the designatum also now is a pair .__c2
__s__yes .__c5
__s.%--__instead of just the meaning .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__b__and that aside from some terminology that's basically it .__c2
__s__right .__c5
__s.%--__i just want to b- - i'm - i'm asking .__c2
__%-__yep .__c5
__fg|s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__um the un- - sort of the un addressed questions in this um definitely would for instance be semantic constraints we talked about .__c5
__qh__yeah .__c2
__b__here are just bindings .__c5
__s:s__but ==__c5
__b.%__right .__c5
__s^bu__we might want to introduce mental spaces .__c5
__qy^d^g__you know there's all these things that we don't ==__c5
__s^bu^e__the whole - the mental space thing is clearly not here .__c2
__s.%--__right .__c5
__s^aa|%-__so there's going to be some extra - you know definitely other notation we'll need for that which we skip for now .__c5
__s^bu^e__uhhuh .__c4
__s__by the way i do want to get on that as soon as robert gets back .__c2
__s^2|s^aa__uh ==__c5
__s^e__yeah .__c5
__fg__okay .__c5
__fh__so uh the - the mental space thing .__c2
__s^bd^no__uhhuh .__c4
__%-__um obviously construal is a b- - is a b- - is a big component of that .__c2
__s__so this probably not worth trying to do anything till he gets back .__c2
__s.%-__but sort of as soon as he gets back i think um we ought to ==__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__s__so what's the - what's the time frame ?__c4
__s^e__i forgot again when ==__c4
__qw.%--__you're going away for how long ?__c4
__s^df.%-__just uh as a - sort of a mental bridge i'm not - i'm skipping fourth of july .__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__okay .__c4
__fg|s__so uh right afterwards i'm back .__c0
__%-__okay .__c4
__%-__what ?__c5
__s^aa^rt__you're missing like the premier american holiday ?__c5
__s^r__what's the point of spending a year here ?__c5
__fh|s^bu__uh i've had it often enough .__c0
__s^aa__so anyway ==__c5
__s^bu^e__well he w- - he went to college here .__c1
__qy^d^f^g__oh yeah | i forgot .__c5
__s__oops sorry .__c5
__s__yeah .__c2
__h__okay .__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__and furthermore it's well worth missing .__c2
__s^bk|s^df^nd__not in california .__c5
__s^df__yeah | that's true .__c5
__s^bd^na__yes .__c4
__%-__i like - i - i like spending fourth of july in other countries whenever i can .__c5
__s^df^nd__right .__c2
__b.%__um ==__c5
__b__okay | so that's great .__c2
__b__construal .__c5
__fg|s^bd__okay | so ==__c5
__s^df^e__oh so there was one question that came out .__c5
__s^df^e__i hate this thing .__c5
__s^aa__sorry .__c5
__s^df__um which is ==__c5
__b__so something like past which i- - you know we think is a very simple - uh we've often just stuck it in as a feature .__c5
__s__right .__c2
__b__you know oh this event takes place before speech time okay is what this means .__c5
__b__right .__c2
__s.%--__um it's often thought of as it is also considered a mental space .__c5
__s^df__right .__c2
__s^am^cs__you know by you know lots of people around here .__c5
__s^am__right .__c2
__s^am__so there's this issue of well sometimes there are really exotic explicit space builders that say in france blah blah blah .__c5
__fg__uhhuh .__c4
__s__and you have to build up - you ha- - you would imagine that would require you you know to be very specific about the machinery .__c5
__%--__whereas past is a very conventionalized one .__c5
__b__and we sort of know what it means .__c5
__fh|%-__but it - we doesn't - don't necessarily want to you know unload all the notation every time we see that it's past tense .__c5
__s.%--__right .__c2
__s__so you know we could think of our - uh just like x. schema walk refers to this complicated structure past refers to you know a certain configuration of this thing with respect to it .__c5
__s^aap|%-__i think that's exactly right .__c2
__s^aa__so - so we're kind of like having our cake and eating it .__c5
__s^f|s^df__you know having it both ways | right ?__c5
__fh__yeah .__c2
__b__so i- - i- ==__c5
__b__yeah | no i think - i think that i- - we'll have to see how it works out when we do the details .__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk__but my intuition would be that that's right .__c2
__fg__uhhuh .__c5
__s^t^tc__yeah okay .__c5
__fg|%-__do you want to do the same for space ?__c0
__b__wha- - sorry ?__c5
__s__space .__c0
__s.%--__space ?__c5
__s__here .__c0
__b__now .__c0
__fh__oh oh oh oh | instead of just time ?__c5
__fh__yeah yeah yeah .__c5
__%--__uhhuh .__c0
__s__same thing .__c5
__s__so there are very conventionalized like deictic ones | right ?__c5
__b__and then i think for other spaces that you introduce you could just attach y- ==__c5
__s^aa|s^aap__whatever .__c5
__s^aa__you could build up an appropriately - uh appropriate structure according to the l- - the sentence .__c5
__s^aa__huh .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__fg|s^e__huh .__c0
__b__well this - this basically would involve everything you can imagine to fit under your c.  dot something .__c0
__s^ba^tc__n- ==__c4
__s^cs^rt^t^tc__yeah .__c5
__s__you know where - where it's contextually dependent .__c0
__s__right .__c5
__s^e__uhhuh .__c5
__s__what is now ?__c0
__s__what was past ?__c0
__s__what is in the future ?__c0
__s__where is this ?__c0
__fh|s__what is here ?__c0
__s__what is there ?__c0
__s__what is ?==__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__so time and space .__c5
__s__um we'll - we'll get that on the other side a little like very minimally .__c5
__s__there's a sort of- - there's a slot for setting time and setting place .__c5
__s.%-__good .__c2
__qy^bu^d__and ==__c5
__s^m^na|s^aa__you know you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place .__c5
__s__and then there are many in- - more interestingly linguistically anyway there are relative things that you know you relate the event in time and space to where you are now .__c5
__s__if there's something a lot more complicated like or so - hypothetical or whatever then you have to do your job .__c5
__x__uhhuh .__c4
__s__like or somebody's job anyway .__c5
__s^e__yeah .__c4
__s^no__i'm going to point to - at random .__c5
__qw__yeah .__c4
__s__i mean i'm - i'm s- - curious about how much of the mental ==__c4
__s^df__i mean i'm not sure that the formalism sort of the grammatical side of things is going to have that much going on in terms of the mental space stuff .__c4
__s.%--__you know um basically all of these so-called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of ==__c4
__s^rt__i think of it as sort of giving you the coordinates of you know ==__c4
__s^ba^df__assuming that at any point in discourse there's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios whatever and the speaker's supposed to be keeping track of those the um - the construction that you actually get is just going to sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you've already got going um you're supposed to add structure to .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__so in france uh watergate wouldn't have hurt nixon or something like that .__c4
__s^aa|s^am__um well you say all right i'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past france universe or something like that .__c4
__%--__the information in the sentence tells you that much .__c4
__s^bk__but it doesn't tell you like exactly what it - what the point of doing so is .__c4
__s__so for example depending on the linguistic con- - uh context it could be ==__c4
__s^ba__like the question is for example what does watergate refer to there ?__c4
__s^ba.%--__does it you know - does it refer to um ?==__c4
__fh__if you just hear that sentence cold the assumption is that when you say watergate you're referring to a watergate like scandal as we might imagine it happening in france .__c4
__s.%--__but in a different context oh you know if nixon had apologized right away it wouldn't - you know watergate wouldn't have hurt him so badly in the u. s .__c4
__qw__and in france it wouldn't have hurt him at all .__c4
__qw^e.%--__now we're s- - now that watergate we're now talking about the real one .__c4
__h|s__they're real | right .__c5
__qy^bu^d^rt__and the would sort of - it's a sort of different dimension of hypothe-theticality | right ?__c4
__s.%-__i see - | right .__c5
__qy^bu^d^e^rt__we're not saying what's hypothetical about this world .__c4
__s__in the first case hypothetically we're imagining that watergate happened in france .__c4
__s^bk__huh .__c5
__s.%-__in the second case we're imagining hypothetically that nixon had apologized right away .__c4
__fg|s__uhhuh .__c5
__%-__right .__c5
__s.%-__or something | right ?__c4
__%-__so a lot of this isn't happening at the grammatical level .__c4
__s^bk|s^bk^m__uh um and so ==__c4
__s^bk__correct .__c2
__s^m^na__uhhuh .__c5
__s__i don't know where that sits then .__c4
__s^bk.%__huh .__c0
__%-__sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant .__c4
__%__it seems like um the grammatical things such as the auxiliaries that you know introduce these conditionals whatever give you sort of the - the most basi- ==__c5
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__th- - those we - i think we can figure out what the possibilities are | right ?__c5
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c4
__s^aa__there are sort of a relatively limited number .__c5
__s__and then how they interact with some extra thing like in france or if such and such that's like there are certain ways that they c- - they can ==__c5
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__you know one is a more specific version of the general pattern that the grammat- - grammar gives you .__c5
__s^bk|qy^bh^rt__i think .__c5
__s^e__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__but you know whatever .__c5
__fh__we - we're ==__c5
__b__yeah | in the short run all we need is a enough mechanism on the form side to get things going .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__fh|s__yeah .__c4
__s^ba^fe__uh i - uh you - you ==__c2
__s^aa__but the whole point of - the whole point of what fauconnier and turner have to say about uh mental spaces and blending and all that stuff is that you don't really get that much out of the sentence .__c4
__fg|s^ba__you know there's not that much information contained in the sentence .__c4
__fh__it just says here .__c4
__s__add this structure to this space .__c4
__s^df__and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open .__c4
__s__an individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on quote what the space configuration is at the time of utterance .__c4
__fh__uhhuh .__c5
__qy^bu^d^rt__uhhuh .__c5
__%-__and so somebody's going to have to be doing a whole lot of work but not me i think .__c4
__h|s.%--__well ==__c2
__s^aa|s^na__i think that's right .__c2
__s^bk__oh i - yeah i uh uh - i think that's not k- - i th- ==__c2
__s__i don't think it's completely right .__c2
__s__i mean in fact a sentence- - examples you gave in f- - did constrain the meaning b- ==__c2
__s^bk__the form did constrain the meaning .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__%-__and so um it isn't uh ==__c2
__fg|s^df__sure | but like what - what was the point of saying that sentence about nixon and france ?__c4
__s^df.%-__that is not - there is nothing about that in the - in the sentence really .__c4
__s^aa__that's okay .__c5
__fg|s__we usually don't know the point of the sentence at all .__c5
__%-__yeah .__c4
__s__but we know what it's trying to say .__c5
__s__we - we know that it's - what predication it's setting up .__c5
__s^bk|s^ba__y- - yeah .__c4
__b__yeah .__c2
__b.%__but - but - bottom line i agree with you .__c2
__%--__yeah .__c4
__s__that's all .__c5
__fh__yeah .__c4
__qy^rt__that - that - that we're not expecting much out of the uh f- ==__c2
__s^no__purely linguistic cues | right ?__c5
__qy^bu^d^m^rt__uh the purely form cues | yeah .__c2
__s^aa__so ==__c5
__fh__huh .__c5
__b.%__and um - | i mean you're - you're the linguist .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__but uh it seems to me that th- - these - we - we - you know we've talked about maybe a half a dozen linguistics theses in the last few minutes or something .__c2
__s^ar__yeah yeah .__c4
__s^bk.%__yeah i mean ==__c2
__qy^rt__yeah .__c4
__s^df__oh yeah .__c4
__s^ar__uh i - i mean that - that's my feeling that - that these are really hard uh problems that decide exactly what - what's going on .__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__qy^rt__okay .__c2
__s^ar__okay | so um one other thing i just want to point out is there's a lot of confusion about the terms like profile designate focus et cetera et cetera .__c5
__s^df^rt__uhhuh .__c4
__s^bk__uh right right right .__c2
__fh__um for now i'm going to say like profile s often used ==__c5
__s^no__like two uses that come to mind immediately .__c5
__%-__one is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else .__c5
__s^df__so hypotenuse you profiled this guy against the background of the right t- - right triangle .__c5
__qy__uhhuh .__c4
__qrr^d__okay .__c5
__s^ar__and the second use um is in framenet .__c5
__s__it's slightly different .__c5
__s^bk__oh i was asking hans about this .__c5
__fh__they use it to really mean um this - in a frame th- - this is - the profiles on the - these are the ones that are required .__c5
__s^bk|s__so they have to be there or expressed in some way .__c5
__s^e__which - which i'm not saying one and two are mutually exclusive .__c5
__s.%-__but they're - they're different meanings .__c5
__s__right .__c2
__s^rt__uhhuh .__c4
__s^aa__so the closest thing ==__c5
__s^ba__so i was thinking about how it relates to this notation .__c5
__s^aa|s^na__for us um ==__c5
__fh__okay | so how is it ?==__c5
__s^tc__so designate ==__c5
__fg|s__does that - is that really what they mean in - in ?==__c2
__s^df__framenet ?__c5
__b__framenet .__c2
__s__i didn't know that .__c2
__fh__yeah yeah .__c5
__b__i - i mean i - i was a little bit surprised about it too .__c5
__s__i knew that ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c2
__fh__i thought that that would be something like ==__c5
__s__there's another term that i've heard for that thing .__c5
__fh__right okay .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__but they - i mean - uh well at least hans says they use it that way .__c5
__s^na__and ==__c5
__s:s__well i'll check .__c2
__b__and may- - maybe he's wrong .__c5
__s:s^no__anyway so ==__c5
__b__i think the - the designate that we have in terms of meaning is really the highlight this thing with respect to everything else | okay ?__c5
__s^e__right .__c2
__qh__so this is what - what it means .__c5
__s__but the second one seems to be useful .__c5
__fh__but we might not need a notation for it .__c5
__s__we don't have a notation for it .__c5
__s__but we might want one .__c5
__b__so for example we've talked about if you're talking about the lexical item walk .__c5
__s__you know it's an action .__c5
__s__well it also has this idea - it carries along with it the idea of an actor .__c5
__s.%--__or somebody's going to do the walking .__c5
__qh__or if you talk about an adjective red it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red .__c5
__s__so we used to use the notation with for this .__c5
__s__and i think that's closest to their second one .__c5
__qh__right .__c2
__s__so i d- - don't yet know i have no commitment as to whether we need it .__c5
__s__it might be ==__c5
__s__it's the kind of thing that w- - a parser might want to think about whether we require ==__c5
__s__you know these things are like it's semantically part of it .__c5
__s^df.%-__n- - no no .__c2
__s^2.%-__well uh th- - critically they're not required syntactically .__c2
__s^aa__often they're pres- - presu- - presupposed and all that sort of stuff .__c2
__s^df__right .__c5
__s^cs__right right | yeah um definitely .__c5
__s__so um ==__c5
__s__in was a good example .__c5
__s__if you walk in like well in what ?__c5
__s^bsc__you know like you have to have the - so - so it's only semantically is it ==__c5
__s__right | there's ==__c2
__s__it is still required say by simulation time though .__c5
__b__to have something .__c5
__b__right .__c2
__s^df^nd__so it's that - i meant the idea of like that the semantic value is filled in by sim- - simulation .__c5
__s^na__i don't know if that's something we need to spa- - to - to like say ever as part of the requirement .__c5
__s.%-__or the construction .__c5
__s^m^na__or not .__c5
__%--__we'll - we'll again defer .__c5
__fh__or - i mean or - or uh ==__c2
__b__so the ==__c2
__s^df__have it construed .__c5
__b__is that the idea ?__c5
__s.%--__yeah yeah .__c2
__s^rt__just point at robert .__c5
__s.%--__whenever i'm confused just point to him .__c5
__s__right .__c2
__s__you tell me .__c5
__s__it's - it's his thesis | right ?__c2
__s^df__okay .__c5
__s__anyway ==__c2
__b__right yeah |  w- - this is going to be a b- ==__c2
__s^no__you're right this is a bit of in a mess .__c2
__s__and we still have emphasis as well or stress or whatever .__c2
__s__okay | well we'll get uh uh i - we have thoughts about those as well .__c5
__s^cs.%--__yeah .__c2
__s^bd^df__great .__c2
__s__um ==__c5
__s__the- - i w- - i would just- ==__c5
__s:s__s- - some of this is just like my - you know by fiat .__c5
__s^cs__i'm going to say this is how we use these terms .__c5
__s__i don't- - you know there's lots of different ways in the world that people use it .__c5
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__fh__i - that's fine .__c2
__s__i think that um the other terms that are related are like focus and stress .__c5
__b__so s- ==__c5
__fh__uhhuh .__c2
__qy^bu^d__i think that the way i - we would like to think uh i think is focus is something that comes up in i mean lots of ==__c5
__s^m^na.%-__basically this is the information structure .__c5
__fg|s^cs__okay it's like - uh it's not - it might be that there's a syntactic uh device that you use to indicate focus .__c5
__qy^g__uhhuh .__c2
__s^cs^e__or that there are things like you know ==__c5
__s^aa__i think keith was telling me things toward the end of the sentence post verbal tend to be the focused focused element .__c5
__s^na__huh .__c4
__s^bk__the new information .__c5
__s__you know if i - i walked into the room you tend to think that whatever into the room is sort of like the more focused kind of thing .__c5
__fg|s__uhhuh .__c4
__qh__yeah .__c4
__s.%--__and when you uh - uh you have stress on something that might be you know a cue that the stressed element or for instance the negated element is kind of related to information structure .__c5
__b__so that's like the new the sort of like import or whatever of - of this thing .__c5
__s__uh so - so i think that's kind of nice to keep focus being an information structure term .__c5
__s^df__stress ==__c5
__s^e__i th- - and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it .__c5
__b__so um - | like stress th- - stress is kind of a pun on - you might have like - whatever like um accent kind of stress .__c5
__fh__uhhuh .__c4
__b__and that's just a ==__c5
__b__uh w- - we'll want to distinguish stress as a form device .__c5
__qw^t^tc__you know like oh high volume or whatever .__c5
__qw__yeah .__c4
__qy.%-__um ==__c5
__qy__t- - uh and distinguish that from it's effect .__c5
__s^aa__which is oh the kind of focus we have is we're emphasizing this value often as opposed to other values | right .__c5
__s^m^na__so focus carries along a scope .__c5
__s^bk__like if you're going to focus on this thing and you want to know it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it wasn't .__c5
__s__um so my classic my now classic example of saying oh he did go to the meeting .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__that was my way of saying - as opposed to you know oh he didn't g- - or there was a meeting .__c5
__fh__i think that was the example that was caught on by the linguists immediately .__c5
__qy__yeah .__c4
__s^no__yeah .__c4
__fg|s^2__and so um the - like if you said he ==__c5
__%-__you know there's all these different things that if you put stress on a different part of it then you're c- - focusing whatever on uh ==__c5
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c4
__s^no__he walked to the meeting as opposed to he ran .__c5
__s^no__or he did walk to the meeting as opposed to he didn't walk | you know .__c5
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__b__so we need to have a notation for that .__c5
__qy__which um ==__c5
__qy^rt__i think that's still in progress .__c5
__%-__so sort of i'm still working it out .__c5
__s^bk|s__but it did - one - one implication it does f- - have for the other side which we'll get to in a minute is that i couldn't think of a good way to say here are the possible things that you could focus on .__c5
__s__because it seems like any entity in any sentence you know or any meaning component of anyth- - you know - all the possible meanings you could have any of them could be the subject of focus .__c5
__s^bk.%__huh .__c2
__s^no__but i think one - the one thing you can schematize is the kind of focus | right ?__c5
__fh__so for instance you could say it's the - the tense on this as opposed to um the - the action | okay .__c5
__b.%__or it's - uh it's an identity thing or a contrast with other things .__c5
__s__or stress this value as opposed to other things .__c5
__fh__so um ==__c5
__s__it's - it is kind of like a profile - profile background thing .__c5
__b__but i - i can't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you would - that you would focu- ==__c5
__s^t^tc.%--__light up with focus | yeah .__c4
__s^bd^no__light - highlight .__c5
__s__as opposed to other ones .__c5
__b__so it has some certain complications for the uh uh later on .__c5
__s__li- - i mean uh the best thing i can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements .__c5
__s__for instance you - oh one other type that i forgot to mention is like query elements .__c5
__b__and that's probably relevant for the like where is you know the castle kind of thing .__c5
__fg|s__uhhuh .__c4
__s^bu__because you might want to say that um location or cert- - certain w. h words bring - you know sort of automatically focus in a you know i don't know the identity of this thing kind of way on certain elements .__c5
__s^bk__so ==__c5
__s^aa__okay anyway | so that's onl- - there are - there are many more things that are uncl- - that are sort of like a little bit unstable about the notation .__c5
__fh__but it's most - i think it's - this is you know the current - current form .__c5
__s^bk__other things we didn't totally deal with um ==__c5
__s.%--__well we've had a lot of other stuff that keith and i have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective .__c5
__s__oh there's a bunch .__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__you know a - a nominal expression .__c5
__fh__and um ==__c5
__b__yeah .__c4
__fg|s.%--__i mean we should have put an example of this .__c5
__s__and we could do that later .__c5
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^rt__but i think the not- - inherently like the general principles still work though .__c5
__qy^rt__that um we can have constructions that have sort of constituent structure in that there is like you know for instance one ==__c5
__h|qy^bu^d__uh you know they - they have constituents | right ?__c5
__qrr.%--__so you can like nest things when you need to .__c5
__s^aa|s^bd__but they can also overlap in a sort of flatter way .__c5
__s^bk__so if you don't have like a lot of grammar experience then like this - this might you know be a little o- - opaque .__c5
__s^bd^e__but you know we have the properties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituents - constituent based grammar .__c5
__s^aa__so that's - i think that's sort of the main thing we wanted to aim for .__c5
__h|s__uhhuh .__c4
__s.%-__and so far it's worked out okay .__c5
__s^bk|s__good .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__so ==__c5
__s^aa__okay .__c5
__s__i can say two things about the f- ==__c0
__s__yes .__c5
__s^aa__maybe you want to forget stress .__c0
__s__this - my f- ==__c0
__%__as a word ?__c5
__s.%--__no | as - as - just don't - don't think about it .__c0
__s__as a ==__c5
__qy^d^f^g__what's that ?__c5
__s^rt__sorry .__c5
__b__if ==__c0
__s__canonically speaking you can - if you look at a - a curve over sentence you can find out where a certain stress is .__c0
__s__and say hey that's my focus exponent .__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__s__right .__c4
__s__it doesn't tell you anything what the focus is .__c0
__fh__uhhuh .__c5
__s__if it's just that thing ==__c0
__s^df__or the constituent that it falls in .__c5
__s__a little bit more or the whole phrase .__c0
__fh__uhhuh .__c4
__s__um ==__c0
__s__you mean t- - forget about stress the form cue ?__c5
__b__the form bit .__c0
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__because uh as a form cue um not even trained experts can always - well they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes .__c0
__s__okay .__c5
__b__and that's also mostly true for read speech .__c0
__fh__in - in real speech um people may put stress .__c0
__qy^rt__it's so d- - context dependent on what was there before phrase ba- - breaks um restarts .__c0
__qrr.%-__yeah .__c5
__h|s.%--__uhhuh .__c5
__s^no__it's just um ==__c0
__qy.%-__it's absurd .__c0
__s__it's complicated .__c0
__%--__okay .__c5
__s^rt__yeah | i mean i - i'm sort of inclined to say let's worry about specifying the information structure focus of the sentence .__c4
__%-__and all ==__c0
__%--__i believe you | yeah .__c5
__%__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bu__and then ==__c4
__s.%-__ways that you can get it come from th- ==__c5
__s^aa|s^am__hhh the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that .__c4
__s^bd__right .__c5
__%-__you know i mean later on we'll worry about exactly how ==__c4
__s^bd^df__or - or map from the contour to - to what the focus exponent is .__c0
__s^bk__y- - yeah .__c4
__s^no__uhhuh .__c5
__%-__exactly .__c4
__s.%-__but figure out how the ==__c4
__s^bk.%__yeah .__c4
__s^e__but uh if you don't know what you're - what you're focus is then you're - you're hopeless-uh-ly lost anyways .__c0
__fh__right .__c5
__s^bk__that's fine | yeah .__c5
__qy^bu^d^rt__uhhuh .__c5
__s^no.%__and the only way of figuring out what that is - is um by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element decide which one in that context makes sense and which one doesn't .__c0
__s^2^na|s^aa__uhhuh .__c5
__b__and then you're left with a couple three .__c0
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c5
__fg|s__so you know again that's something that h- - humans can do .__c0
__s__um but far outside the scope of - of any - anything .__c0
__s__so ==__c0
__s__you know ==__c0
__s__it's ==__c0
__s__okay | well uh yeah i wouldn't have assumed that it's an easy problem in - in absence of all the oth- ==__c5
__%--__u- - u- ==__c0
__qy__you need all the other information i guess .__c5
__s.%-__but it's - it's - what it - uh it's pretty easy to put it in the formalism though .__c0
__s.%-__i mean because ==__c0
__fg__yeah .__c5
__s^na__you can just say whatever stuff i- - is the container being focused or the - the entire whatever both and so forth .__c0
__s^bd^df__uhhuh uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c4
__b__yeah exactly | so the sort of effect of it is something we want to be able to capture .__c5
__b__yeah | so b- - b- - but i think the poi- ==__c2
__s^e__i'm not sure i understand .__c2
__s__but here's what i th- - think is going on .__c2
__b__that if we do the constructions right when a particular construction matches it - the fact that it matches does in fact specify the focus .__c2
__s__w- - uh ==__c5
__qh__i'm not sure about that .__c5
__s^df__or it might limit - it cert- - certainly constrains the possibilities of focus .__c5
__b__okay .__c2
__s__uh - k- - uh at- - at the very least it constrai- ==__c2
__s__i think that's - that's th- - that's certainly true .__c5
__s__and depending on the construction it may or may not f- - specify the focus | right ?__c5
__s__oh uh for sure | yes .__c2
__s__there are constrai- - yeah it's not every - but there are constructions uh where you t- - explicitly take into account those considerations ==__c2
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s^df__that you need to take into account in order to decide which - what is being focused .__c2
__s^j__uhhuh .__c5
__fh__uhhuh .__c0
__s__so we talked about that a little bit this morning .__c0
__fh__john is on the bus .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s.%--__not nancy .__c0
__fh__huh .__c5
__s__so that's - focuses on john .__c0
__fh__right .__c2
__s^bu^t^tc__john is on the bus and not on the train .__c0
__h|s^no__uhhuh .__c5
__fh__right .__c2
__s^e^no__john is on the bus versus john is on the train .__c0
__fh__right .__c5
__s^bk__and john is on the bus versus was and e- ==__c0
__s.%-__is on .__c5
__s__john is on the bus .__c5
__s__it's the bu- - so e- ==__c0
__s^aa__yeah yeah .__c5
__b__right .__c2
__s__yeah | all - all of those .__c2
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__fh__right .__c5
__s__all of these .__c0
__b__and will we have - u- ?==__c0
__b__is it all the same constructions ?__c0
__b__just with a different foc- - focus constituent .__c0
__fh__yeah | i would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like sort of ==__c5
__s^ba^tc__uhhuh .__c0
__fg|qh.%--__i don't know .__c5
__s__the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some - whatever is predicated anyway should be the same set of constructions .__c5
__fh__so that's why i was talking about overlapping constructions .__c5
__s__so then you have a separate thing that picks out you know stress on something relative to everything else .__c5
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s^cs^t^tc__uhhuh .__c4
__fh__so the question is actually ==__c2
__s^cs^t__and it would ==__c5
__s^aa__oh i'm sorry .__c2
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__go ahead .__c2
__s__finish .__c2
__s__and it w- - and that would have to - uh it might be ambiguous as uh whether it picks up that element or the phrase or something like that .__c5
__s__but it's still is limited possibility .__c5
__s__huh .__c0
__s^e__so that should you know interact with - it should overlap with whatever other construction is there .__c5
__s__yeah .__c0
__fh__s- - s- - the question is do we have a way on the other page uh when we get to the s- - semantic side of saying what the stressed element was or stressed phrase or something ?__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__well so that's why i was saying how ==__c5
__fh__since i couldn't think of an easy like limited way of doing it um all i can say is that information structure has a focused slot .__c5
__s__right .__c2
__s^bd^df__and i think that should be able to refer to ==__c5
__s__so that's down at the bottom here when we get over there .__c2
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__okay .__c2
__s^no__and infer - and i don't have - i don't have a great way or great examples .__c5
__s__i'll- - i'll wait .__c2
__s__but i think that - something like that is probably going to be uh more - more what we have to do .__c5
__s__okay .__c2
__%__huh .__c0
__s__but um ==__c5
__s__okay .__c2
__s^rt__so ==__c0
__s__okay | that was one comment .__c5
__s__and you had another one ?__c5
__s__yeah | well the - once you know what the focus is the - everything else is background .__c0
__s.%--__how about topic comment ?__c0
__s.%--__that's the other side of information .__c0
__s__how about what ?__c5
__s__topic comment .__c0
__s__yeah | so that was the other thing .__c5
__s__and so i didn't realize it before .__c5
__s__it's like oh ! it was an epiphany that it - you know topic and focus are a contrast set .__c5
__s.%--__so topic is ==__c5
__s__topic focused seems to me like um background profile | okay ?__c5
__s__or a landmark trajector or some- - something like that .__c5
__b__there's - there's definitely um that kind of thing going on .__c5
__%-__huh .__c0
__qw__now i don't know whether ==__c5
__s^ba__i n- - i don't have as many great examples of like topic indicating constructions .__c5
__s__on like focus | right ?__c5
__fh__um topic - it seems kind of - you know i think that might be an ongoing kind of thing .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__s^rt__japanese has this though .__c4
__s__topic marker ?__c5
__s__you know ==__c4
__b__yeah | that's what wa is .__c4
__s__yeah .__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__s^2__uh just to mark which thing is the topic .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__s__it doesn't always have to be the subject .__c4
__s__right .__c5
__s^bk__so again information structure has a topic slot .__c5
__s^bk__and you know i stuck it in thinking that we might use it .__c5
__s.%-__uhhuh .__c0
__s.%-__um i think i stuck it in .__c5
__s__yep | it's there .__c2
__s.%-__um and ==__c5
__s^ng__one thing that i didn't do consistently um is - when we get there is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role .__c5
__s__i think i have an idea of what it should be .__c5
__s^e__but th- ==__c5
__s__you know so far we've been getting away with like either a type constraint or um you know whatever .__c5
__s__i forg- - it'll be a frame .__c5
__s__you know it'll be - it'll be another predication or it'll be um i don't know some value from - from some- - something some variable and scope or something like that .__c5
__s__or a slot chain based on a variable and scope .__c5
__s__okay | so well that's ==__c5
__s__should we flip over to the other side officially then ?__c5
__s.%--__uhhuh huh .__c0
__s__i keep uh like pointing forward to it .__c5
__s__okay | side one .__c4
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__now we'll go back to s- ==__c5
__s.%--__okay | so this doesn't include something which mi- - mi- - may have some effect on - on it .__c5
__s__which is um the discourse situation context record .__c5
__s__right | so i didn't - i - i meant just like draw a line .__c5
__s__and like you know you also have uh some tracking of what was going on .__c5
__fh__right .__c2
__s__and sort of - this is a big scale comment before i you know look into the details of this .__c5
__s__but for instance you could imagine instead of having ==__c5
__s|qy^d^f^g__i - i changed the name of - um it used to be entities .__c5
__s__so you see it's scenario referent and discourse segment .__c5
__s__and scenario is essentially what kind of - what's the basic predication .__c5
__s__what event happened .__c5
__s__and actually it's just a list of various slots from which you would draw - draw in order to paint your picture a bunch of frames bi- - and bindings | right ?__c5
__qy^bu^d^rt__um and obviously there are other ones that are not included here .__c5
__%__general cultural frames and general like uh other action f- ==__c5
__qy^rt__you know specific x. schema frames .__c5
__s^aa|s^na__uhhuh .__c4
__%-__okay | whatever .__c5
__s^bk__the middle thing used to be entities .__c5
__s^aa__because you could imagine it should be like really a list .__c5
__fg|s__where here was various information .__c5
__s^df__and this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent - uh you know about some entity that you were going to talk about .__c5
__fh__so harry walked into the room .__c5
__s.%--__harry and room .__c5
__%__you know the room ==__c5
__s__th- - but they would be represented in this list somehow .__c5
__s__and it could also have for instance it has this category slot .__c5
__s__um it should be either category or in- - or instance .__c5
__s^e__basically it could be a pointer to ontology .__c5
__s__so that everything you know about this could be - could be drawn in .__c5
__s__but the important things for grammatical purposes are for - things like number gender .__c5
__s.%--__um - ki- - the ones i included here are slightly arbitrary .__c5
__s__but you could imagine that um you need to figure out wheth- ==__c5
__s__if it's a group whether um some event is happening .__c5
__s__linear time linear spaces .__c5
__s__like you know are - are they doing something serially .__c5
__s__or is it like ==__c5
__s__um uh | i'm - i'm not sure .__c5
__s.%--__because this partly came from uh talmy's schema .__c5
__s__and i'm not sure we'll need all of these actually .__c5
__s__but ==__c5
__s__um and then the status i used was like again in some languages you know like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status .__c5
__s__so th- - the - the big com- - and - and finally discourse segment is about sort of speech act y information structure y .__c5
__s__like utterance-specific kinds of things .__c5
__s^df__so the comment i was going to make about um changing entity - the entity's block to reference is that you can imagine your discourse ==__c5
__s^df__like situation context ==__c5
__fh__you have a set of entities that you're sort of referring to .__c5
__s__and you might - that might be sort of a general i don't know database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to .__c5
__s__and i changed to reference .__c5
__s^ba__because i would say for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it .__c5
__s__and those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here .__c5
__fh__for instance i know it's going to be plural .__c5
__s__i know it's going to be feminine or something like that .__c5
__s__and - and these could actually just point to you know the - the i. d in my other list of enti- - active entities | right ?__c5
__s__so um ==__c5
__s^ba^df__uh th- - there's - there's all this stuff about discourse status we've talked about .__c5
__b__i almost listed discourse status as a slot where you could say it's active .__c5
__s__you know there's this um hierarchy - uh there's a schematization of you know things can be active or they can be um accessible inaccessible .__c5
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s__it was the one that you know keith um emailed to us once to some of us .__c5
__b__not all of us .__c5
__fh__and ==__c5
__s__the thing is that that - i noticed that that um list was sort of discourse dependent .__c5
__s__it was like in this particular set s- - you know instance it has been referred to recently or it hasn't been .__c5
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s__or this is something that's like in my world knowledge but not active .__c5
__s__this ==__c2
__s__uh - yeah | well there - there seems to be context properties .__c2
__s__so ==__c5
__s^e__yeah | they're contex- - and for instance i used to have a location thing there .__c5
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s__but actually that's a property of the situation .__c5
__s__and it's again time you know - at cert- - certain points things are located you know near or far from you .__c5
__s__well uh uh this is recursive .__c2
__s__and ==__c5
__fh__because until we do the uh mental space story we're not quite sure - th- - th- ==__c2
__s__yeah .__c5
__b__which is fine .__c2
__fh__yeah yeah .__c5
__s^rt^tc__we'll just - we'll j- ==__c2
__b__so some of these are uh ==__c5
__s.%--__we just don't know yet .__c2
__b__right .__c5
__fh__so i - so for now i thought well maybe i'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance | right ?__c5
__s.%--__everything else here is utterance-specific .__c5
__s__um and i left the slot predications open .__c5
__b.%__because you can have um things like the guy i know from school .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__or you know like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na- - amounts of prep- - you know predications that you might make .__c5
__fh|s__uhhuh .__c4
__s^f__and it's unclear whether ==__c5
__s__i mean you could just have in your scenario here are some extra few things that are true | right ?__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__b__and then you could just sort of not have this slot here | right ?__c5
__s.%-__you're - but - but it's used for identification purposes .__c5
__s^2__so it's - it's a little bit different from just saying all these things are true from my utterance .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__yeah .__c4
__b__right .__c2
__s^rt__yeah .__c4
__s^df__um ==__c5
__s^df__right | this guy i know from school came for dinner does not mean um there's a guy i know him from school .__c4
__s__and he came over for dinner .__c4
__s__that's not the same effect .__c4
__b__yeah | it's a little bit - it's a little bit different .__c5
__s__right | so ==__c5
__%__or maybe that's like a restrictive non restrictive ==__c5
__s__you know it's like it gets into that kind of thing for ==__c5
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__s__um but maybe i'm mixing you know - this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence .__c5
__s^df.%--__so you might imagine that the information you pass to you know - in identifying a particular referent would be oh some - you know it's a guy .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__and it's someone i know from school .__c5
__s__so maybe that would you know be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc- - to the whatever construal engine or whatever discourse context to find - you know either create this reference .__c5
__s__yeah .__c4
__fh|s__in which case it'd be created here .__c5
__fh__uhhuh .__c4
__s__and ==__c5
__s__you know so - so you could imagine that this might not ==__c5
__s^df__so uh i'm uncommitted to a couple of these things .__c5
__s^df__but - to make it m- - precise at least in my mind uh it's not precise .__c0
__fh__um ==__c5
__fg|s.%-__so house is gender neuter ?__c0
__b__um | it could be in ==__c5
__%-__in reality ?__c0
__fg__or in ?==__c0
__s^2__semantically .__c2
__s^aa|s^na__semantically yeah | yeah .__c5
__s^aa|s__semantically .__c0
__%-__so ==__c0
__s^aa|s__so it uh uh a table .__c5
__s__you know a thing that c- - doesn't have a gender .__c5
__s__so | uh it could be that - i mean ==__c5
__fh__maybe you'd - maybe not all these ==__c5
__b__i mean i wou- - i would say that i tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most - most things .__c5
__s__no | just to make sure that we - everybody that's - completely agreed that it - it has nothing to do with uh form .__c0
__s__yeah .__c5
__s.%--__okay | that is semantic as opposed to ==__c5
__s^bd^df__yeah yeah | that's right .__c5
__s^df__um ==__c5
__s__s- - so again ==__c5
__b__then predications makes sense to - to have it open for something like uh accessibility or not .__c0
__s.%--__open to various things .__c5
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__right .__c5
__fh__okay | so let's see .__c5
__s^t^tc.%--__so maybe having made that big sca- - sort of like large scale comment should i just go through each of these slots - uh each of these blocks um a little bit ?__c5
__s__sure .__c4
__b__um mostly the top one is sort of image schematic .__c5
__fh|s__and just a note .__c5
__s__which was that um ==__c5
__s__s- - so when we actually ha- ==__c5
__s__so for instance um ==__c5
__s__some of them seem more inherently static | okay .__c5
__s__like a container or sort of support-ish .__c5
__s^e__and others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic .__c5
__fh__like source path goal is often thought of that way .__c5
__s__or force or something like that .__c5
__s__but in actual fact i think that they're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that .__c5
__s__and different x. schemas use them in a way that's either static or dynamic .__c5
__qh__so path you could just be talking about the path between this and this .__c5
__b__huh .__c4
__s^no__and you know container that you can go in and out .__c5
__s.%--__all of these things .__c5
__s__and so um ==__c5
__s__i think this came up when uh ben and i were working with the spaniards um the other day .__c5
__s|qy^d^f^g__the spaniettes as we called them .__c5
__b__um to decide like how you want to split up like s- - image schematic contributions versus like x. schematic contributions .__c5
__s__how do you link them up ?__c5
__s__and i think again um it's going to be something in the x. schema that tells you is this static or is this dynamic .__c5
__s__so we definitely need - that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that .__c5
__s|qy^d^g^rt__um | that you know is it uh a state or is it a change of state or is it a um action of some kind .__c5
__s__uh i- - i- - i- - is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you don't ?__c0
__s__uh ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__b__just means ==__c0
__s__oh oh | you mean in the slot ?__c5
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__fg__um no | it's like x. sc- - it's - it's like i was thinking of type constraints .__c5
__fh|s__but x. schema well it obviously has to be an x. schema .__c5
__s__agent i mean the - the performer of the x. schema .__c5
__s__that s- - depends on the x. schema .__c5
__s^e__you know and i - in general it would probably be you know ==__c5
__fh|s__so the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were .__c4
__fh__yeah | basically .__c5
__s^tc__uhhuh .__c0
__s^bk__okay .__c4
__qy^cs^rt__um aspectual type probably isn't obvious .__c5
__s^e^rt__but i should have - so i just neglected to stick something in perspective actor undergoer observer um ==__c5
__qy^bu^d^rt__huh .__c1
__s^aa|s__i think we've often used agent patient obser- ==__c5
__s^bk.%--__whee !__c4
__s__that's that one | right ?__c4
____yeah | exactly exactly .__c5
__s^fe__um | and so one nice thing that uh we had talked about is this example of like if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is ch- - you know - definitely it is one way to - for you to you know specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object .__c5
____and so then we talked about you know whether well does that specify topic as well ?__c5
____well maybe there are other things .__c5
____you know now that it's - subject is more like a topic .__c5
____and now that you know ==__c5
__s^bk^rt__anyway | so ==__c5
__s^bk__sorry | i'm going to trail off on that one .__c5
