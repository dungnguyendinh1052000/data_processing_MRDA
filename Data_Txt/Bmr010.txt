__z__that's looks strange .__c9
__z__okay .__c1
__z__oh there we go .__c4
__z__now we're on and it seems to be working .__c1
__z__one two three four five six .__c2
__z__this looks good .__c4
__z__that is weird .__c0
__z__it's like when it's been sitting for a long time or something .__c0
__z__so i mean ==__c1
__z__i don't know what it is .__c1
__z__but all - all i know is that it seems like every time i am up here after a meeting and i start it it works fine .__c1
__z__and if i'm up here and i start it and we're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting it gives me that error message .__c1
__z__and i have not yet sat down with - been able to get that error message in a point where i can sit down and find out where it's occurring in the code .__c1
__z__next time you get it maybe we should write it down .__c0
__qy^rt^t__yep we will .__c1
__s^ar__yeah .__c3
__s^na__was it a pause or ?==__c4
__s__one of these days .__c1
__s^no.%--__okay .__c4
__s^aa__was it on pause or something ?__c4
__s^e__no .__c1
__s^j__okay .__c4
__s^j__don't know .__c4
__fg__so | uh so the uh the new procedural change that just got suggested which i think is a good idea is that um we do the digit recordings at the end .__c3
__%-__and that way if we're recording somebody else's uh meeting and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time uh then they can run off .__c3
__qh^t__it'll mean we'll get somewhat fewer uh sets of digits .__c3
__s^aa^rt__but um | i think that way we'll cut into people's time um if someone's on strict time uh less .__c3
__s^aa__so i th- - i think - i think we should start doing that .__c3
__s__um so | uh let's see we were having a discussion the other day maybe we should bring that up about uh the nature of the data that we are collecting .__c3
__s^bk__uh | @reject@ that uh we should have a fair amount of data that is um collected for the same meeting so that we can ==__c3
__fh|s^rt^t__uh ==__c3
__s^e^rt__i don't know .__c3
__s^bk|s^t.%--__wh- - what - what were some of the points again about that ?__c3
__s^cs^t__is it ?==__c3
__s__uh | well okay i'll back up .__c9
__s^bk^rt__um at the previous - at last week's meeting this meeting i was griping about wanting to get more data .__c9
__s^nd__yeah .__c3
__s^ba__and i - i talked about this with jane and adam .__c9
__s^aa__um | and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um since we'll have a new - this new student di- - does want to work with us .__c9
__s^aa__th- - the guy that was at the last meeting .__c9
__s__well great .__c0
__s^aa.%--__great .__c0
__s^bk^rt__and he's already funded part time .__c9
__fh__so we'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part time .__c9
__s.%--__what a deal .__c0
__s.%-__uh yeah .__c9
__s^aa__and what's he interested in specifically ?__c1
__s^bk^rt__so ==__c9
__s^t__he's - comes from a signal processing background .__c9
__%-__but i liked him a lot .__c9
__fh|s__because he's very interested in higher level things like language and disfluencies and all kinds of eb- - maybe prosody .__c9
__fh|qy^bu^d^rt__uhhuh .__c1
__s^nd__so he's just getting his feet wet in that .__c9
__s^bk^m__great .__c1
__s^bk^m__anyway | i thought okay maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts - he'd be starting in january next semester that we'd have you know enough data to work with .__c9
__s^am__right .__c1
__s__but um | jane and adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you m- - you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want and so forth .__c9
__s^m__so | i thought about that and i think it's still possible .__c9
__s^co^rt__um | but i'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about and hear then sort of a mish mosh of a bunch of one - onetime .__c9
__s.%__one offs .__c1
__b.%__yeah just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses .__c9
__fh__both to get the - um to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it like well i was talking to morgan about .__c9
__qy^rt__things like summarization or what's this meeting about .__c9
__s^br^j^rt__i mean | it's very different if you have a group that's just giving a report on what they did that week versus coming to a decision and so forth .__c9
__fh__so | then i was um talking to morgan about some new proposed work in this area sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where i was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns .__c9
__qw.%-__like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech .__c9
__s^br^j^r^rt__sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the diff- - different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to listen to .__c9
__qw__and in that uh regard i thought we definitely w- - will need it'd b- - it'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains or a few different kinds of meetings .__c9
__s^aa|s^co__so this - this meeting is one of them .__c9
__b__although i'm not sure i can participate if i ==__c9
__s^co__you know i would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analyzing later for things like summarization .__c9
__fh__uhhuh .__c1
__b__um | and then there are some others that menti- - that morgan mentioned .__c9
__h|s^t__like the front end meeting and maybe a networking group meeting .__c9
__s^na__right .__c1
__s^aa__yep .__c1
__s^bk__yeah | we're - we're hoping that they'll let us start recording regularly .__c1
__fh|s.%--__so - so if that were the case then i think we'd have enough .__c9
__s.%--__so ==__c1
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__fh|s__but basically for anything where you're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting um it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize .__c9
__s^e__yeah .__c1
__s^e__but - rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries .__c9
__fh|s.%--__and then we need a couple that - of - we don't want to just have one group .__c9
__s__because that might be specific to that particular group but three or four different kinds .__c9
__b__s- - so ==__c3
__fh__yeah we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting .__c1
__s__see i've never listened to the data for the front end meeting .__c9
__b__yeah .__c2
__fh|s__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah we - we've only had three .__c1
__s__so ==__c1
__b__okay .__c9
__fh|s.%--__but maybe that's enough .__c9
__s:qw__so in general i was thinking more data .__c9
__fh|s__but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar .__c9
__b__like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same .__c9
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s__um ==__c1
__b.%__now | let - l- - l- - let me just give you the other side to that .__c3
__%--__because i ca- - because i - i don't disagree with that .__c3
__s__but i think there is a complimentary piece to it too .__c3
__s^df__uh | for other kinds of research particularly the acoustic oriented research i actually feel the opposite need .__c3
__b.%__i'd like to have lots of different people .__c3
__s__right .__c9
__s^cs__right .__c9
__s^df__as many people here a- - a- - and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view .__c3
__b.%__i'd like to have many different speakers .__c3
__s__so um | i think i would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings of somebody coming down from campus and - and uh ==__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__b__i mean sure if we can get more from them fine .__c3
__fh__uhhuh .__c4
__s__right .__c9
__fh__but if we only get one or two from each group that still could be useful acoustically just because we'd have close and distant microphones with different people .__c3
__s^bk__yeah | i definitely agree with that .__c9
__qh^t^tc__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c4
__qy.%--__definitely .__c9
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__can i - can i say about that - that the - the issues that i think adam and i raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers .__c4
__s^bk__because i think if you just say ==__c4
__s^aa__an- - and in particular my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you'd have so- - people who'd have proficiency enough in english that - that uh it would be useful for - for purposes you know .__c4
__h|s^rt__uhhuh .__c3
__b^rt__but you know i think i've been - i've i - i've gathered data from undergrads at - on campus .__c4
__fh|s^rt__and if you just post randomly to undergrads i think you'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you'd have at all and - and the english you'd have - the language models would be really hard to build .__c4
__s^e^rt__well | you want to i- ==__c3
__s__because it would not really be - it would be an interlanguage rather than than a ==__c4
__s__well | okay uh first place i - i - i don't think we'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another .__c3
__b__okay .__c4
__b__i think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point because i - i think that's what we're investigating .__c3
__s.%--__it has to be a - a pre-existing meeting like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway .__c9
__s__so ==__c3
__s^2__yeah yeah .__c3
__s^e__right .__c1
__s^e__okay .__c4
__s__so | i was - i was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh and - and - and uh senior uh uh d- - and uh doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their - hold their meeting down here .__c3
__s__yep .__c1
__s__that's i think what we - and i agree with .__c9
__qy^bu^d^rt__oh interesting !__c4
__qrr.%--__yeah .__c2
__s^na__oh i see .__c4
__fh|s__oh interesting !__c4
__b__uh that's the first point .__c3
__fh|s__the second point is ==__c3
__s__um ==__c3
__s^aa__i think that for some time now going back through berp i think that we have had speakers that we've worked with who had non native accents and i th- - i think that ==__c3
__s^aa__oh oh | i'm not saying accents .__c4
__s^na__the accent's not the problem .__c4
__h|s__oh okay .__c3
__s__no | it's more a matter of uh proficiency .__c4
__b__e- - e- - just simply fluency .__c4
__s__i mean i deal with people on - on campus who - i think sometimes people undergraduates um in computer science uh have language skills that make - you know that their - their fluency and writing skills are not so strong .__c4
__qy^rt__yeah .__c3
__s__oh !__c3
__qrr.%-__you're not talking about foreign language at all .__c3
__s^bk__yeah yeah just talking about .__c1
__s^e__you're just talking about ==__c3
__b__well | e- - i just think ==__c4
__qw.%-__we all had the same thought .__c1
__s__but you know it's like when you get into the graduate level uh no problem .__c4
__fh__i mean i'm not saying accents .__c4
__qw__uhhuh .__c2
__s^am__yeah then we're completely gone .__c3
__b__i'm say- - i'm saying fluency .__c4
__s__it's - the - the habits are already burnt in .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__b__well yeah .__c4
__s__i'm just saying fluency .__c4
__s__but ==__c3
__b^rt__well i think that um i think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in english .__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__and - and i think if it's a pre existing meeting and it's held in english i - i think it's probably okay if a few of the people don't have g- - uh particularly good english skills .__c1
__s^e__okay now can i - can i say the other aspect of this from my perspective .__c4
__fg__which is that um there's - there's this - this issue you have a corpus out there it should be used for - for multiple things .__c4
__fg__because it's so expensive to put together .__c4
__s__right .__c1
__qw.%-__right .__c3
__qy^rt__and if people want to approach ==__c4
__fg__um ==__c4
__s^na__i so i know e- - e- - you know this ==__c4
__s^df__the idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group .__c4
__s^e__uhhuh .__c3
__s.%--__but the idea of language models which are fund- - you know generally speaking uh you know t- - t- - terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data .__c4
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__uhhuh .__c3
__s__if you have a choice between people who are pr- - more proficient in um i- - more fluent more - more close to being academic english then it would seem to me to be a good thing .__c4
__fh__i guess - i- - maybe ==__c3
__fg|s^bu__huh .__c3
__b.%__because otherwise y- - you don't have the ability to have ==__c4
__s^aa__i- ==__c3
__s^aa^r__uh so if - if you have a bunch of idiolects that's the worst possible case .__c4
__s__if you have people who are using english as a - as an interlanguage because they - they don't uh they can't speak in their native languages and - but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing uh language model .__c4
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c3
__b__this is the worst case scenario .__c4
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__b.%__well that's pretty much what you're going to have in the networking group .__c3
__s^aa__and ==__c4
__b__right .__c1
__b__because - because they - most - the network group is almost entirely germans and spaniards .__c3
__b.%__well ==__c4
__s^aa__oh .__c4
__fg__but the thing is i think that these people are of high enough level in their - in their language proficiency that ==__c4
__s^arp__i see .__c3
__fg__and i'm not objecting to accents .__c4
__s^aa__i - i'm - i'm just thinking that we have to think at a - at a higher level view could we have a language model a - a grammar a grammar basically that um wo- - would be a - a possibility .__c4
__s^e__okay .__c3
__s^ba__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__so y- - so if you wanted to bring in a model like dan jurafsky's model an- - and do some top down stuff it - to help th- - the bottom up and merge the things or whatever uh it seems like um i don't see that there's an argument .__c4
__fg|s^t__uhhuh .__c3
__fh|s__i'm - i - what i think is that why not have the corpus since it's so expensive to put together uh useful for the widest range of - of central corp- - things that people generally use corpora for and which are you know used in computational linguistics .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__fh|s__that's - that's my point which - which includes both top down and bottom up .__c4
__qy__okay .__c3
__s^ar__it's difficult .__c2
__s^ar|s__yeah .__c2
__s__okay well i- - i- - let's - let's see what we can get .__c3
__%-__i mean it - it - i think that if we're aiming at - at uh groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together and it's from the berkeley campus probably most of it will be okay .__c3
__s.%--__yes that's fine .__c4
__s.%--__that's fine .__c4
__s.%--__exactly .__c4
__s__and my point in m- - in my note to liz was i think that undergrads are an iff- - iffy population .__c4
__s^df__but ==__c3
__s^bk__okay .__c3
__s^bk|s__i definitely agree with that i mean for this purpose .__c9
__b__okay .__c3
__s__okay .__c3
__b.%__grads and professors fine .__c4
__%-__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__well not to mention the fact that i would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen probably even an- - anyone under twenty one .__c1
__b.%__yeah .__c2
__b.%__so ==__c1
__s.%--__oh you age-ist !__c3
__s.%--__what's that ?__c1
__s^e__age-ist .__c4
__s.%--__well age-ist - the eighteen is because of the consent form .__c1
__s__right yeah .__c9
__s^e__yeah .__c2
__s^e__we'd have to get - find their parent to sign for them .__c1
__s__age-ist .__c2
__s__yeah yeah .__c2
__s__yes .__c3
__b__yeah that's true .__c4
__s__so ==__c1
__s__i have a - uh um question .__c9
__fh|s^cs__well morgan you were mentioning that mari may not use the k- - equipment from i b m if they found something else because there's a ==__c9
__s.%--__they're - they're - yeah they're d- - they're uh - assessing whether they should do that or y- - do something else hopefully over the next few weeks .__c3
__s.%--__because i mean one remote possibility is that if we st- - if we inherited that equipment if she weren't using it could we set up a room in the linguistics department ?__c9
__s^cs__and - and i mean there - there - may be a lot more - or - or in psych or in comp- - wherever in another building where we could um record people there .__c9
__s^df__i think we'd have a better chance .__c9
__s__i think we'd need a real motivated partner to do that .__c1
__s__right .__c9
__b__we'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this .__c1
__fh__but ==__c9
__s__right .__c9
__s__but if there were such a ==__c9
__fh|qy__i mean it's a remote possibility then um you know one of us could you know go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here .__c9
__s^aa__yep .__c1
__fh|s^rt__so it's just a - just a thought if they end up not using the - the hardware .__c9
__b__well | the other thing yeah i mean the other thing that i was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around .__c3
__s^rt__right .__c1
__s__uh .__c3
__s^e__but um | and ==__c3
__%--__well i know that space is really scarce on - at least in c s .__c1
__b__uh .__c3
__fh__you know to - to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult .__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^rt__but you may not need a separate room you know .__c9
__s__that's true .__c1
__s^e__the idea is if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something .__c9
__s^fa^t3.%__yeah .__c3
__s^e__true .__c1
__s^m__uhhuh .__c1
__s^bk__yep .__c1
__s__well maybe john would let us put it into the phonology lab or something .__c3
__b__huh .__c9
__s__yep .__c1
__s^rt__you know .__c3
__s__i - i think it's not out of the question .__c9
__s^cs__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah i think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting .__c1
__s^bk__um .__c9
__fg|s^am__so ==__c9
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__another type of meeting .__c1
__s.%--__right .__c9
__s__right .__c9
__b__but i - i - i think you need uh another portable thing a- - another portable equipment to - to do uh more e- - easier the recording process uh out from icsi .__c2
__s^bk|s__huh .__c1
__%-__yeah .__c3
__b__uh | and probably i don't know .__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__qy.%--__right .__c1
__s^ar|s__uh if you - you want to - to record uh a seminar or a class uh in the university you - you need - it - it would be uh uh very difficult to - to put uh a lot of uh head phones uh in different people when you have to - to record only with uh this kind of uh d- - device .__c2
__s^ar|s.%-__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__yeah but ==__c1
__s^bk__i think if we - if we want to just record with the tabletop microphones that's easy .__c1
__b__oh- - yeah .__c2
__s^bk^r__ye- - yeah yeah .__c2
__s.%--__right ?__c1
__s^nd__that's very easy .__c1
__s:s__but that's not the corpus that we're collecting .__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__actually that's a int- - that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that's maybe worth repeating .__c3
__s__we realized that um when we were talking about this that okay there's these different things that we want to do with it .__c3
__s^bk__so um | it's true that we want to be selective in some ways uh the way that you were speaking about with uh not having an interlingua and uh these other issues .__c3
__s^bk__but on the other hand it's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it .__c3
__s^tc.%--__so a- - a- - as per the example that we want to have a fair amount that's done with a small n- - recorded with a small uh typ- - number of types of meetings .__c3
__fh|%--__but we can also have another part that's uh just one or two meetings of each of a - of a range of them .__c3
__s__and that's okay too .__c3
__s__uh | i- - we realized in discussion that the other thing is what about this business of distant and close microphones .__c3
__b__i mean we really want to have a substantial amount recorded this way .__c3
__s__that's why we did it .__c3
__b^rt__but what about - for th- - for these issues of summarization a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone .__c3
__s__right .__c9
__s__i mean i c- - i think there's ==__c9
__s^rt__you actually don't .__c3
__s__and you don't really need the close microphone you mean .__c1
__sj^ba^df__yeah .__c2
__s__yea- - yeah yeah you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone .__c9
__fg__which one did you mean ?__c4
__%-__you d- - you don't ne- - it doesn't - you just need some microphone somewhere .__c3
__s__you can use found data .__c9
__b__ye- - yeah yep .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__b__tape recorder .__c1
__s__oh .__c4
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^cs^tc.%--__you - you can .__c9
__b__you need some microphone .__c3
__s^cs__you can .__c9
__b__use - um but i think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect ==__c9
__sj^ba__but i mean ==__c3
__sj^ba__uhhuh .__c1
__fg|s__yeah .__c3
__s__you know each person who's interested in - i mean we have a cou- - we have a bunch of different um slants and perspectives on what it's useful for um they need to be taking charge of making sure they're getting enough of the kind of data that they want .__c9
__sj^ba__right .__c3
__b__and so in my case um i think there w- - there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others .__c9
__qy^rt^tc__not enough for others | right .__c1
__s.%--__and so i'm looking and thinking well i'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it's - to help th- - in my interest .__c9
__fh__uhhuh .__c1
__qo^t1__and other people need to do that for themselves uh h- - or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal .__c9
__s__right | so that ==__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__but i think that - i'm raising that because i think it's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about well gee we have this really complicated setup to do well maybe you don't .__c3
__qy^bh__maybe if - if - if really all you want is to have a - a - a recording that's good enough to get a - uh a transcription from later you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording .__c3
__qy^rt__yeah .__c1
__s^bk|s__for some of it .__c1
__s.%--__right .__c9
__s__yep .__c1
__s__i mean we - we could have a fairly - we could just get a dat machine and ==__c3
__%--__well i agree with jane though on the other hand that ==__c9
__s__yeah .__c2
__fh__so that might be true you may say for instance summarization or something that sounds very language oriented .__c9
__s__you may say well oh yeah you just do that from transcripts of a radio show .__c9
__b__i mean you don't even need the speech signal .__c9
__s.%--__right .__c3
__s__but what you - what i was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um ==__c9
__s__suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this .__c9
__b__there's lots of cues you're not going to have .__c9
__sj^ba__so i do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of - of interests and have this parallel information which is really what makes this corpus powerful .__c9
__sj^ba__right .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__fh|s__yeah .__c2
__s__special ?__c1
__b^rt__yep .__c1
__s__i - i - i - i - i agree .__c3
__fh__otherwise you know lots of other sites can propose - individual studies so ==__c9
__qy^bh__uh | but i - i think that the uh - i- - we can't really underestimate the difficulty - shouldn't really u- - underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up .__c3
__s__yep .__c1
__qy^bu^df^rt__and so - uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say oh we'll just do it up there  .__c3
__b__okay .__c9
__s^aa__if you're talking about something simple where you throw away a lot of these dimensions then you can do that right away .__c3
__s^cs__talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here .__c3
__b__it won't happen quickly it won't be easy and there's all sorts of issues about th- - you know keeping the equipment safe or else hauling it around and all sorts of o- ==__c3
__s^aa__so then maybe we should try to bring people here .__c9
__s^bk|sj^ba__i think the first priority should be to pry to get - try to get people to come here .__c3
__fg|s^tc__here .__c1
__b__i mean that's that's ==__c9
__s__okay so .__c9
__s__we're set up for it .__c3
__s^e__uhhuh .__c4
__b__okay .__c9
__b^rt__the room is - is really uh underused .__c3
__s__right .__c9
__s^rt.%--__uh ==__c3
__s.%--__i thought the free lunch idea was a great idea .__c4
__s__yeah i thought so too .__c1
__s__yeah | i - and - i think we can get people to come here that ==__c9
__b^rt__free lunch is good .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__sj^ba__but the issue is you definitely want to make sure that the kind of group you're getting is the right group .__c9
__b__so that you don't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down .__c9
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__fg__no crunchy food .__c0
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__so well it would be lunch afterwards .__c9
__s.%-__yeah .__c4
__s^ar|s__well i was thinking lunch after .__c1
__s^df__right .__c9
__s^bk|%-__and they'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert .__c9
__s__yeah they have to do their digits or they don't get - they don't get their food .__c3
__s__yep .__c1
__s^ng__yeah .__c9
__s^e__yeah .__c3
__b__um | i had a - i spoke with some people up at haas business school who volunteered .__c1
__fg__should i pursue that ?__c1
__s__oh definitely yeah .__c9
__b__yeah .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__b__so ==__c1
__s^bd__they - they originally - they've decided not to do - go into speech .__c1
__b__so i'm not sure whether they'll still be so willing to volunteer .__c1
__s.%--__but i'll send an email and ask .__c1
__s__tell them about the free lunch .__c3
__b__i'll tell them about the free lunch .__c1
__b__yeah .__c9
__s.%-__yeah .__c9
__s__and they'll say there's no such thing .__c1
__s__so ==__c1
__b__i'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers because these are both weird .__c9
__s__right .__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__b.%__yeah .__c2
__s__the - the - the oth- - the other h- ==__c3
__b__well i know i shouldn't say that .__c9
__qy__that's all right .__c1
__s__no the- - they - they're very weird .__c1
__s^rt__we need a wider sampling .__c9
__s^bk__beep .__c0
__s__uh ==__c3
__s^bk|s^cs__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__beep .__c3
__s__uh | the - the ==__c3
__s^bk|s__the problem with engineers is beep .__c1
__fg|s__they make funny sounds .__c3
__b__the o- - the o- - the other - the other thing is uh that we - we talked about is give to them - uh burn an extra c d rom .__c3
__s^bk__yep let them have their meeting .__c1
__fh__and give them - so if they want a - basically and audio record of their ==__c3
__fg|s__well i thought that was - i thought he meant give them a music c d like they g- - then he said a c d of the - of their speech .__c9
__fh__oh .__c3
__s__and i guess it depends of what kind of audience you're talking to .__c9
__s__but you know i personally would not want a c d of my meeting .__c9
__qy^rt__of the meeting .__c1
__h|s^na__but maybe - yeah maybe you're ==__c9
__s.%--__if you're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you'd like ==__c3
__s^bk__right right right .__c9
__s^bk__oh that's a good idea .__c0
__s__it'd be fun .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s__i think it would just be fun you know if nothing else you know .__c1
__fh__right .__c9
__fg|s__yeah .__c2
__fg__but it als- - it - it - it also i think builds up towards the goal .__c3
__s__it's a novelty item .__c1
__s^rt__right .__c9
__s^rt__we're saying look you know you're going to get this .__c3
__s__is- - is- - isn't that neat .__c3
__b__then you're going to go home with it .__c3
__b__it's actually p- - it's probably going to be pretty useless to you .__c3
__s__yep .__c1
__s__but you'll ge- - appreciate you know where it's useful and where it's useless .__c3
__fh__right .__c9
__b__and then we're going to move this technology so it'll become useful .__c3
__fh__no i think that's a great idea actually .__c9
__s__so ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__b__but we might need a little more to incentivize them that's all .__c9
__b__what if you could tell them that you'll give them the - the transcripts when they come back ?__c0
__s.%--__alth- ==__c4
__fh__oh yeah .__c1
__s.%--__i mean anyone can have the transcripts so i thought we could point that out .__c1
__fh__oh yeah .__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__s.%-__well that's interesting .__c9
__s__i hav- - i have to uh raise a little eensy weensy concern about doing th- - giving them the c d immediately because of these issues of you know this kind of stuff where maybe you know .__c4
__%-__good point .__c3
__s^aa|s^m__so ==__c4
__s^2.%--__that's a very good point .__c3
__s__we could burn it after it's been cleared with the transcript stage .__c4
__b__so we can - so we can ==__c3
__s__r- - right .__c3
__s__and then they - they get a c d but just not the same day .__c4
__b__oh right .__c9
__fh__if - it should be the same c d rom that we distribute publically .__c9
__b__yeah that's right .__c1
__b__that's a good point .__c1
__s__right ?__c9
__b__right it can't be the internal one .__c1
__fh__otherwise they're not allowed to play it for anyone .__c9
__s__although it's ==__c3
__s.%--__there we go .__c4
__b__oh i like that .__c4
__fh__that's right .__c1
__s.%--__well put well put .__c4
__s^df__so after the transcript screening phase .__c4
__sj^ba__yeah that's true .__c1
__b__things have been weeded out .__c4
__fg__otherwise we'd need two lawyer stages .__c9
__fh__yeah that's right say yeah well i got this c d and your honor i ==__c4
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__that's a good point .__c9
__s^rt__yeah so that's - so let's start with haas and yeah .__c3
__s^df__sorry to have to - sorry i have to leave .__c9
__fg|s__i will be here full time next week .__c9
__fh__oh that's fine .__c3
__b__okay see you .__c1
__s__okay .__c3
__b__no .__c1
__b__bye .__c1
__b__that's all right .__c3
__s^bk__see you .__c0
__fh|s__okay .__c3
__s.%-__see you .__c2
__fg|s.%--__so uh | let's see .__c3
__sj^ba^bu__so that was that topic .__c3
__qy^g__and | then um i guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question .__c3
__b.%__for ==__c3
__fh|s^no__we are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp- - room to record meetings .__c1
__s.%--__so i uh did a bunch of archiving and still doing a bunch of archiving .__c1
__b__i - i'm in the midst of doing the p files from uh broadcast news .__c1
__s__and it took eleven hours to do - to uh - copy it .__c1
__s__eleven ?__c2
__s.%--__and it'll take another eleven to do the clone .__c1
__fh__where did you copy it to ?__c0
__fh__well it's abbott .__c1
__s__it's abbott so it just but it's - it's a lot of data .__c1
__b__sk- - it's copying from one place on abbott to another place on abbott ?__c3
__s__tape .__c1
__b__tape ?__c2
__b__i did an archive .__c1
__fg|qw^rt^t^tc__oh !__c3
__h|%--__i'm sorry .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__oh on the tape .__c0
__qw.%--__oh .__c2
__s^aa__uh .__c0
__s__so i'm archiving it and then i'm going to delete the files .__c1
__b__so that will give us ten gigabytes of free space .__c1
__s.%-__eleven hours ?__c2
__qy^d^rt__wow !__c0
__%-__oh .__c2
__s^aa__yeah the archiving m- - program does take a long time .__c4
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__and - and ==__c1
__fh__yep .__c1
__s__and so one- - that - that will be done like in about two hours .__c1
__s:qy^rt__and so uh | at that point we'll be able to record five more meetings .__c1
__b__so ==__c1
__s:qrr__yeah .__c2
__s:qrr__one thing - the good news about that - that is that once - once it's archived it's pretty quick to get back .__c4
__fg__yeah .__c2
__s__i mean it - it - it - the other direction is fast but this direction is really slow .__c4
__b__is it ?__c3
__b__right .__c1
__s.%-__huh .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^m__well especially because i'm generating a clone also .__c1
__s^bk|qr__yeah okay .__c4
__sj^ba__so and that takes a while .__c1
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__qw__generating a clone ?__c0
__qw^e__yeah that's a good point .__c4
__s__two copies .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__one offsite one onsite .__c1
__s^bk__oh .__c0
__s__oh .__c0
__s^df__huh .__c0
__b__now what will uh - is the plan to g- - to - so stuff will be saved it's just that you're relocating it ?__c4
__b__s- ==__c3
__fg|s^co__i mean so we're going to get more disk space ?__c4
__s^bk|s^cc__or did i ?==__c4
__sj^ba__no | the - the - these are the p files from broadcast news which are regeneratable regeneratable .__c1
__b.%__okay .__c4
__b__oh good .__c4
__s__i see .__c4
__b__um if we really need to but we had a lot of them and - for the full uh hundred forty hour sets .__c1
__s.%--__okay .__c4
__b__and so they - they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something .__c1
__s__wow !__c4
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__wow !__c4
__b__w- - w- - we are getting more space .__c3
__s__we are getting uh another disk rack and - and four thirty six gigabyte disks .__c3
__s__uh so | uh but that's not going to happen instantaneously .__c3
__s.%--__wonderful .__c4
__s__or maybe six .__c1
__s__or maybe six ?__c3
__b__the sun ha- - uh takes more disks than the andatico one did .__c1
__s^bk__how many ?__c3
__s__the sun rack takes th- - one took four and one took six or maybe it was eight and twelve whatever it was it was you know fifty per cent more .__c1
__s__how much ?==__c3
__fh__is there a difference in price or something ?__c0
__b__well what happened is that we - we bought all our racks and disks from andatico for years according to dave .__c1
__fh|s__and andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices .__c1
__b__oh !__c0
__s__oh .__c2
__b__and so uh we're looking into other vendors .__c1
__b__we - by we of course i mean dave .__c1
__fh__wow .__c4
__fh__so ==__c1
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c0
__qy^d^e^g^rt.%--__huh i've been looking at the uh aurora data and um first - first look at it there were basically three directories on there that could be moved .__c0
__s^fe__one was called aurora one was spanish which was carmen's spanish stuff and the other one was um spine .__c0
__s^cs__spine .__c1
__s^bk|s^no__and so um | i wrote to dan and he was very concerned that the spine stuff was moving to a non backed up disk .__c0
__s^aa__so um | i realized that well probably not all of that should be moved just the c d rom type data the - the static data .__c0
__qr^rt__so i moved that and then um i asked him to check out and see if it was okay .__c0
__s^co^r__before i actually deleted the old stuff um but i haven't heard back yet .__c0
__qrr.%--__i told him he could delete it if he wanted to i haven't checked today to see if he's deleted it or not .__c0
__s^ar|s.%--__and then carmen's stuff i realized that when i had copied all of her stuff to x a i had copied stuff there that was dynamic data .__c0
__%--__and so i had to redo that one and just copy over the static data .__c0
__s^na__and so i need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk .__c0
__s^no__and then i lo- - haven't done any of the aurora stuff .__c0
__s^j__i have to meet with uh stephane to do that .__c0
__b__so ==__c0
__s__so but uh y- - you're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you're clearing up from the broadcast news .__c3
__sj^ba__but we have some other disks some of which you're using for aurora .__c3
__sj^ba__but are we g- - do we have some other other space now ?__c3
__b__yep .__c1
__fg__so so | uh we have space on the current disk right now where meeting recorder is .__c1
__qw^t^tc__yeah .__c3
__s^cs^rt.%--__and that's probably enough for about four meetings .__c1
__qo^cs__yeah .__c3
__s^aa|sj^ba__is that the one that has - is that d c ?__c0
__s.%--__so ==__c1
__fg__yep .__c1
__s__no no .__c1
__s^df__well it's wherever the meeting recorder currently is .__c1
__s__i think it's d i .__c1
__s__okay .__c0
__s__i - but the stuff i'm moving from aurora is on the d c disk that we ==__c0
__qy__i don't remember .__c1
__qrr__th- - i think it's d c- - it's whatever that one is .__c1
__s^na__okay d c .__c0
__s__i just don't remember it might be d c .__c1
__s__yeah .__c0
__fh__and that has enough for about four more meetings right now .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__fh|s^cs__yeah i mean we were at a hundred per cent and then we dropped down to eighty six for reasons i don't understand .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__um | someone deleted something somewhere .__c1
__s^aa__and so we have some room again .__c1
__s^bk__and then with broadcast news that's five or six more meetings .__c1
__s__so you know we have a couple weeks .__c1
__s^e__uh | so yeah i think - i think we're okay until we get the new disk .__c1
__s__okay .__c2
__fh__so should - um - one question i had for you was um we need - we sh- - probably should move the aurora an- - and all that other stuff off of the meeting recorder disk .__c0
__b__is there another backed up disk that you know of that would ?==__c0
__s^cs__we should put it onto the broadcast news one .__c1
__s__that's probably the best thing to do and that way we consolidate meeting recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out .__c1
__fh__okay .__c0
__qy^d^rt__right .__c0
__s.%--__right .__c0
__b__do you know what - happen to know what disk that is off ?__c0
__b__no .__c1
__s:qh^rt__okay .__c0
__b__i mean i can tell you i just don't know off the top of my head .__c1
__qw^rt__yeah .__c0
__h__okay .__c0
__s.%-__all right i'll find out from you .__c0
__s__but so we could jus- - just do that at the end of today once the archive is complete and i've verified it .__c1
__s^no__okay .__c0
__s^bk__because that'll give us plenty of disk .__c1
__s^bk__uh okay | so uh then i guess th- - the last thing i'd had on my - my agenda was just to hear - hear an update on what - what jose has been doing .__c3
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c2
__fh__so ==__c3
__s.%--__okay .__c2
__s__i have uh the result of my work during the last days .__c2
__s__okay .__c3
__b.%__thank you for your information because i - i read - uh and the - the last uh days uh i work uh in my house uh in a lot of ways and thinking reading uh different things about the - the meeting recording project .__c2
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^df__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__and i have uh some ideas .__c2
__s__uh this information is very - very useful .__c2
__s__i'm glad to hear it glad to hear it .__c4
__s__you have the - the - the distribution now .__c2
__s:s__but for me uh is interesting because uh uh here's i- - is the demonstration of the overlap uh problem .__c2
__s__i've seen it already .__c1
__b__it's a real problem a frequently problem uh because you have overlapping zones uh - uh - uh - all the time .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__yep .__c1
__b__yeah .__c2
__b__throughout the meeting .__c1
__s__uh by a moment i have uh - nnn - the uh n- - i - i did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording .__c2
__b__with uh a exact mark .__c2
__fh|s.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__b__oh you did that by hand ?__c1
__s__that's uh yet b- - b- - yeah by - b- - b- - by hand - by hand because uh uh why .__c2
__s^aa__can i see that ?__c1
__s.%-__can i get a copy ?__c1
__s^cc__oh .__c3
__s__my - my idea is to work ==__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__i - i - i do- - i don- - i don't - i don't know uh if uh it will be possible because i - i - i haven't a lot uh enough time to - to - to work uh only just uh six months as you know .__c2
__s.%-__wow !__c0
__b__but uh my idea is uh is very interesting to - to work in - in the line of uh automatic segmenter .__c2
__sj^ba__uhhuh .__c1
__fh__uh but uh uh in my opinion we need uh uh a reference uh session to - t- - to - to evaluate the - the - the tool .__c2
__s__yes absolutely .__c1
__fh__and so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ?__c1
__s^e__and - no no with i- ==__c2
__b__sorry ?__c2
__s__have you done that or are you planning to do that ?__c1
__s^e__no i - i plan - to do that .__c2
__b__okay .__c1
__s__darn !__c1
__b__i plan - i plan but uh uh the idea is the - is the following .__c2
__s.%-__now uh i need um to detect uh all the overlapping zones exactly .__c2
__s__i - i will - i will uh talk about uh in the - in the blackboard about the my ideas .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__duration .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__b__uh um | uh this information uh with uh exactly time marks uh for the overlapping zones uh - overlapping zone and uh a speaker a a - pure speech uh uh speaker zone .__c2
__fh__i mean uh zones uh of uh speech of uh one speaker without any - any uh noise uh any - any acoustic event uh that uh uh w- - uh is not uh speech - real speech .__c2
__s^j__and | i need t- - true uh silence .__c2
__s__for that because my - my idea is to - to study the nnn - the - the set of parameters uh what uh are more m- - more discriminant to uh classify .__c2
__s__right .__c1
__b.%__the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech uh zones .__c2
__b__the idea is to uh - to use uh - i'm not sure - to - uh yet but uh my idea is to use a - a cluster uh algorithm or nnn a person strong in neural net algorithm to uh - to uh study .__c2
__s__what is the uh the property of the different feat- - uh feature uh to classify uh speech and overlapping uh speech .__c2
__%--__huh .__c0
__b__and my idea is uh it would be interesting to - to have uh a control set .__c2
__s__and my control set uh will be the uh silence silence without uh any - any noise .__c2
__s^rt__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__which means that we'd still - you'd hear the ==__c4
__s__yeah that's interesting .__c4
__s__yeah acoustic with this - with - with - yeah the background .__c2
__s__yeah fans .__c1
__s__this is like a ground level with - it's not- - it's not total silence .__c4
__fh__uh i - i mean uh noise uh uh claps uh tape clips uh the difference uh ==__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__b__uh uh event uh which uh uh has uh uh a hard effect of distorti- - spectral distortion in the - in the uh speech .__c2
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c3
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c4
__b__so so you intend to hand mark those and exclude them ?__c1
__s^cs^e__yeah i have mark- - in - in - in - in that - not in all - in all the - the file .__c2
__s^df__uhhuh .__c1
__s.%-__only uh uh nnn huh i have uh um i don't remind what is the - the - the - the quantity .__c2
__s__but uh i - i have marked enough speech on over- - and all the overlapping zones .__c2
__%-__i have uh two hundred and thirty more or less overlapping zones and is similar to - to this information .__c2
__s^r__whew !__c1
__qy^rt__great great .__c4
__s^df.%-__uhhuh .__c1
__s^aa__because with the program i cross the information of uh of jane with uh my - my segmentation by hand .__c2
__s^bk__and is uh mor- - more similar .__c2
__s^aa^r__excellent .__c4
__s^aa__glad to hear it .__c4
__%-__good .__c4
__s__@reject@ but ==__c2
__s^e__sorry sorry .__c2
__s:s__@reject@ go ahead .__c3
__fh__and the - the idea is uh i - i will use uh - i want - my idea is uh to uh to classify .__c2
__s.%-__i should've got the digital camera .__c1
__s^df__oh well .__c1
__s^co^j__i - i need uh - the exact uh mark of the different uh uh zones .__c2
__s__because i - i want to put uh for uh each frame a label - indicating it's a sup- - supervised and uh hierarchical clustering process .__c2
__s__i - i - i put uh uh for each frame a label indicating what is th- - the type what is the class uh which it belong .__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__s^cs__uh i mean the class you will overlapping speech overlapping is a class uh speech @reject@ the class that's ==__c2
__s^cs^e__non speech .__c1
__b__these will be assigned by hand ?__c0
__b__a- - i - i - i ha- - i h- - i - i put the mark by hand .__c2
__s^e__based on the ?==__c0
__fg__uhhuh .__c0
__s.%--__because uh my idea is uh in - in the first session i need uh i - i need uh to be sure that the information uh that uh i - i will cluster is - is right because uh uh if not uh i will i will uh return to the speech file to analyze uh what is the problems .__c2
__s.%--__well training and validation sure .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s^aa__uh and i - i'd prefer - i would prefer the- - to - to have uh this labeled automatically .__c2
__%-__but uh uh fro- - th- - i need truth .__c2
__b__you need truth huh .__c0
__s^aa__yeah but this is what you're starting with .__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__i've got to ask you so uh the difference between the top two i- ==__c4
__s__yeah yeah yeah .__c2
__s__so - so - i start at the bottom so silence is clear .__c4
__b__by speech do you mean speech by one sp- - by one person only ?__c4
__fh|s__speech ==__c2
__%-__so this is un- - okay and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time or - or a speaker and a breath overlapping someone else's breath or - or clicking overlapping with speech so that - that's all those possibilities in the top one .__c4
__b__yeah .__c2
__s.%-__yeah .__c2
__b__yeah .__c2
__b__is ==__c2
__b__one or- - two or more .__c1
__s^j^no__one two three .__c2
__s.%--__but ==__c2
__fh|s__no by th- - by the moment n- - yeah yeah yeah .__c2
__fh|s.%-__yeah .__c2
__s^j__yeah .__c2
__s__okay .__c4
__b__uh in the first moment because uh uh i - i have information uh of the overlapping zones uh information about if the uh overlapping zone is uh from a speech clear speech from a one to a two uh speaker or three speaker or is - is the zone where the breath of a speaker uh overlaps uh onto uh a speech another especially speech .__c2
__b__so it's basi- - it's basically speech wi- - som- - with - with something overlapping which could be speech but doesn't need to be .__c4
__s__no no | es- - especially uh overlapping speech from uh different uh uh speaker .__c2
__b__no but there's - but i think she's saying where do you in these three categories where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech ?__c3
__s__uh .__c2
__s^cs^t.%--__uh !__c2
__s__which category do you put that in ?__c3
__qw^rt__yeah that's right that's my question .__c4
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__s^no__yeah he- - here i - i put uh speech from uh from uh one speaker without uh uh any - any - any events more .__c2
__fg|%--__oh !__c4
__qh^cs^t__right | so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a non speech event at the same time ?__c3
__fg|%--__which catege- - which category ?__c3
__s^t__like a c- ==__c4
__fh__where where what is the class ?__c2
__s__no by the moment no .__c2
__s__oh .__c4
__b^rt__yeah yeah that's what he was saying before .__c1
__fh__so you don't - i- - i- - it's not in that ==__c4
__s^cs.%-__oh so you - not - not marked .__c3
__fg__for - for the - by the @reject@ no @reject@ because i - i - i - i want to limit the - the nnn - the - the study .__c2
__s^2^rt__okay .__c3
__s^cs__got it .__c3
__b__fine | so so ==__c3
__s^na__yeah so that's what he was saying before is that he excluded those .__c1
__fh__so you're not using all of the data .__c0
__s__the - all - i - exactly .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__sj^ba__yeah you mean .__c2
__s^e__so you're ignoring overlapping events unless they're speech with speech .__c4
__s__yeah be- ==__c2
__s__yeah that's fine .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^rt__okay .__c4
__b__why ?__c2
__s__why ?__c2
__fh|s__what's the reason ?__c2
__s^co.%--__because i- - it's the first study .__c2
__s^t3__@reject@ oh no - no | it's a perfectly sensible way to go .__c3
__s^e__the first ==__c2
__s^nd.%-__we're just- ==__c4
__s__we just wondered - trying to understand what - what you were doing .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__yeah because you've talked about other overlapping events in the past .__c4
__s^bk__okay .__c3
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__s^cs__so - this is this - is - a subset .__c4
__%-__yeah .__c2
__b__in the - in the future the - the idea is to - to extend the class .__c2
__s__is - is ?==__c0
__s__to consider all the - all the information you - you mentioned before .__c2
__s^no__yeah yeah | i - i don't think we were asking for that .__c3
__b__okay ==__c4
__s__we were jus- - just trying to understand .__c3
__s^ba__yeah .__c4
__%-__but uh the - the first idea because uh i don't know what hap- - what will happen with the study .__c2
__s^co.%--__yeah we just wanted to know what the category was here .__c4
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^co__right .__c1
__%-__sure .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c2
__b__is your silence category pure silence or ?==__c0
__s__what if there was a door slam or something ?__c0
__b^rt__i- - it's pure ==__c2
__s__no no | it's pure silence .__c2
__s^aa__pure silence .__c0
__qy^rt__it's the control set .__c2
__b__okay .__c0
__s__okay .__c2
__s__it's the control set .__c2
__s^aa__what you ==__c3
__fh__it's pure si- - pure silence with the - with the machine on the - on the roof .__c2
__b__well ==__c3
__fh|s__w- - i - i think what you m- - i think what you mean is that it's non speech segments that don't have impulsive noises .__c3
__s^bk__with the fan .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c2
__qo__right ?__c3
__qy^rt__because you're calling - what you're calling event is somebody coughing or clicking or rustling paper or hitting something which are impulsive noises .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__but steady state noises are part of the background .__c3
__s^na__yeah .__c2
__b__which are being included in that .__c3
__s__right ?__c3
__fh|s__@reject@ h- - here yet yet i - i - i - i - i think - i - i think uh there are - that - some kind of noises that uh don't - don't wanted to - to be in that uh in that control set .__c2
__s.%-__yeah .__c3
__b__so it's like a signal noise situation .__c4
__s^2__yeah .__c4
__s^m__well ==__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__qw__but i prefer i prefer at - at the first uh the - the silence with uh this uh this kind of the of uh of noise .__c2
__s^rt__well steady state .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__right | it's - i mean it's - background might be - might be a better word than silence .__c3
__qy^d^rt__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__it's just sort of that - the - the background acoustic .__c3
__s^aa|s__yeah .__c2
__s^ar__yeah .__c3
__qy^d^rt__yeah .__c2
__s^df__right | so fine go on .__c1
__fh|s__is - is - is only ==__c2
__fg|s^cs__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__okay .__c2
__s^aa__well we needed to get the categories yeah .__c4
__s__and um with this information the idea is uh uh nnn i have a label for - for each uh frame and uh with a cluster uh - algorithm i - and ==__c2
__s^aa__sorry .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__and uh i am going to prepare a test bed uh well uh a - a set of feature structure uh uh models .__c2
__b__right .__c1
__s^cs.%--__and my idea is ==__c2
__x__tone whatever .__c1
__s__@reject@ @reject@ so - so - on - because i have a pitch extractor yet .__c2
__b__right .__c3
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__s.%-__i have to - to test but uh i ==__c2
__s__you have your own ?__c0
__s__yeah yeah yeah .__c2
__s^bk__oh !__c0
__s^aa__i ha- - i have prepare .__c2
__s^aa__is a modified version of - of - of a pitch tracker uh from uh standar- - uh stanford university .__c2
__s.%--__in stanford ?__c2
__fh|s__no .__c2
__s__from uh them cambridge university .__c2
__s.%-__oh !__c0
__qy^2^bu^d^rt__what's it written in ?__c0
__s^aa^m__uh - them - i - i - i don't remember what is the - the name of the - of the author .__c2
__qw^rt__because i - i have several - i have uh uh them uh library tools from uh festival and - of - from edinburgh uh from cambridge uh - and from our department .__c2
__s__uh .__c0
__s__uhhuh uhhuh .__c3
__s^m__and - and i have to - because in general the pitch tracker doesn't work very well and ==__c2
__s^ba__bad .__c1
__s^bk__right .__c1
__s__but you know as a feature it might be okay .__c1
__fh__yeah yeah .__c2
__b__so we don't know .__c1
__s^t3__this - this is and th- - the idea is to - to uh to obtain uh for example uh uh diff- - uh uh different - well no a great number of uh f e c for example uh uh twenty five uh thirty - thirty parameters uh for - for each one .__c2
__s^bk^t3__and in a first uh - nnn -  step in the investi- - in the research - in- - uh my idea is try to uh to prove what is the performance of the difference parameter uh to classify the different uh what is the - the - the - the front end approach to classify uh the different uh frames of each class uh and what is the - the - nnn - nnn - nnn - uh - what is the the error uh of the data .__c2
__s__supervised clustering .__c1
__s^e__uhhuh .__c1
__b__this is the - the uh first idea .__c2
__fh__uhhuh .__c4
__s__and the second is try to - uh to use some ideas uh similar to the linear discriminant analysis .__c2
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c1
__s^bk__uh ==__c2
__b__uh similar because the- - the idea is to - to study what is the contribution of uh each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different - the different parameters .__c2
__qy^co^rt__uhhuh .__c1
__s^fa__what sort of classifier ar- ?==__c1
__s^df__uh the - the - the classifier is - nnn by the moment is uh is uh similar nnn that the classifier used uh in a quantifier - vectorial quantifier is uh used to - to uh some distance to - to put uh a vector uh in - in a class different .__c2
__s^bk__is yeah - w- - with a model is - is only to cluster using a uh @reject@ or a similarity .__c2
__s^co^rt__@reject@ unimodal ?__c1
__b.%__uhhuh .__c4
__s.%--__so is it just one cluster per ?==__c1
__s^no__a- - another possibility it to use uh a netw- - netw- - a neural network .__c2
__s__right .__c1
__s__but uh what's the p- - what is my idea ?__c2
__s^aa__what's the problem i - i - i - i see in - in - in - if you - you use the - the neural network ?__c2
__s^aa|s.%-__if w- - when this kind of uh huh cluster clustering algorithm to can test to can uh observe what happened you you can't - you can't uh uh put up with your hand in the different parameter .__c2
__s^na__right | you can't analyze it .__c1
__s.%-__but uh if you use a neural net is - is a good idea but uh you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net .__c2
__b__well actually you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different parce- - pieces of the input are .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__it's hard to - w- - w- - what you - it's hard to tell on a neural net is what's going on internally .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__fh__but it's actually not that hard to analyze it and figure out the effects of different inputs especially if they're all normalized .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s.%-__yeah .__c2
__b__um | but ==__c3
__b__well using something simpler first i think is probably fine .__c1
__b__well this isn't tru- - if - if - if you really wonder what different if - if ==__c3
__qy^2^d^rt__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__but ==__c2
__s^bk__decision tree .__c1
__s__yeah then a decision tree is really good .__c3
__fh|qh__but the thing is here he's - he's not - he's not like he has one you know a bunch of very distinct variables like pitch and this - he's talking about like a- - all these cepstral coefficients and so forth .__c3
__fh__right .__c1
__qh^cs^tc__yeah .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__right .__c1
__h|s__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__in which case a- - a- - any reasonable classifier is going to be a mess and it's going to be hard to figure out what - what uh ==__c3
__s^df__and ==__c2
__s__right .__c1
__s__i - i - i will include too the - the - the differential de- - derivates too .__c2
__s^co^j__yeah .__c3
__s__deltas .__c1
__sj^ba__yeah so .__c1
__s^rt__i - i mean i think the other thing that one - i mean this is i think a good thing to do to sort of look at these things at least ==__c3
__s^df__see what i'd - i'd - let me tell you what i would do .__c3
__s__i would take just a few features instead of taking all the m f c c's or all the p l p's or whatever i would just take a couple .__c3
__sj^ba__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__okay .__c3
__fh__like - like c one c two something like that so that you can visualize it .__c3
__s__and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots .__c3
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__okay so before you do - build up any kind of fancy classifiers just take a look in two dimensions at how these things are split apart .__c3
__s__that i think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__and the second thing is once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers @reject@ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties .__c3
__s^rt__so if you're just looking at a frame and a time you don't know anything about you know the structure of it over time and so you may want to build @reject@ - build a markov model of some sort uh or - or else have features that really are based on um on - on some bigger chunk of time .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__b__context window .__c1
__s.%-__yeah .__c2
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^fe__but i think this is a good place to start .__c3
__qy__but don't uh- - anyway this is my suggestion is don't just you know throw in twenty features at it the deltas and the delta del- - and all that into some classifier even - even if it's k nearest neighbors you still won't know what it's doing even - you know it's not a neural net .__c3
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__s:s__yeah yeah .__c2
__s:s__uh i think to know what it's - to have a better feeling for what it's doing you want to look at it .__c3
__b__so you want to look at - at som- - some picture that shows you here's these things uh uh are - offer some separation .__c3
__s:qw__yep .__c1
__b__and uh in l p c uh the thing to particularly look at is i think is something like uh the residual - the energy in the residual .__c3
__s.%--:s.%--__yeah .__c2
__b__um so .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__can i ask ?__c4
__s__it strikes me that there's another piece of information um that might be useful and that's simply the transition .__c4
__b__s- ==__c2
__s.%--__so w- - if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech there's going to be a b- - a big informative area there it seems to me .__c4
__b__yeah because ==__c2
__s__yeah yeah .__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah i - yeah but uh i - i - is my- - my - my own vision of the - of the project .__c2
__s:s__so some sort of ==__c1
__s__that's ==__c1
__s^df__uhhuh .__c4
__s^2__i - uh the - the meeting recorder project for me has uh two uh w- - has uh several parts several p- - objective .__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__b__uh because it's a a great project .__c2
__s__but uh at the first in the acoustic uh uh parts of the project uh i think you uh we have uh two main uh objective .__c2
__s__one - one of these is to - uh to detect the change the acoustic change .__c2
__b__and | for that if you don't use uh uh a speech recognizer uh broad class or not broad class to - to try to - to to label the different frames i think the ike criterion or bic criterion uh will be enough to detect the change .__c2
__s__@reject@ .__c4
__s:s__and - probably - i - i - i - i would like to - to t- - prove .__c2
__fh|s__uh probably when you you have uh uh s- - uh the transition of speech or - or silence uh to overlap zone this criterion is enough with - probably with uh this kind of uh uh the the the more uh use uh use uh used uh them normal regular uh parameter m f- - m f c c .__c2
__s:s__you - you have to - to - to find - you can find the - the mark .__c2
__s:qw__you can find the nnn - the - the acoustic change .__c2
__sj^ba__but uh uh i - i understand that you - your objective is to uh classify to know that uh that zone not is only a new zone in the - in the file that uh you have uh but you have to - to - to know that this is overlap zone .__c2
__s__because in the future you will uh try to - to process that zone with a non- - regular uh uh speech recognizer model i suppose .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s^cs__you - you will pretend to - to - to process the overlapping z- - uh zone with another kind of algorithm .__c2
__b.x__because it's very difficult to - to - to obtain the transcription from uh using uh uh a regular normal speech recognizer .__c2
__qw^j__that you know i - i - i think is the idea .__c2
__s.%-__and so uh the - nnn - the - the system uh will have two models .__c2
__s__clustering .__c4
__s__a model to detect more acc- - the mor- - most accurately possible that is p- - uh will be possible the uh the mark the change .__c2
__s__okay .__c4
__b__and another - another model will @reject@ or several models to try s- - but uh several model- - uh robust models sample models to try to classify the difference class .__c2
__s.%-__i'm - i'm - i'm sorry i didn't understand you - what you said .__c1
__fh__what - what model ?__c1
__s__@reject@ .__c4
__s__uh the - the classifiers of the- - of the n- - to detect the different class to the different zones before try to - to recognize uh with uh to transcribe with uh a speech recognizer .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s__so p- ==__c4
__fh__and my idea is to use uh for example a neural net .__c2
__sj^ba__with the information we obtain from this uh this uh study of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to uh to put the class of each frame uh for the difference zone .__c2
__sj^ba__features .__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__yeah .__c1
__s__you - you uh uh have obtained in the first uh step with the for example bic uh uh criterion compare model .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__and you ==__c2
__s__okay but i - i think - in any event we're agreed that the first step is .__c3
__s^cs.%--__i don't - u- ==__c2
__s^aap__yeah .__c4
__b__i- ==__c2
__s^cs^ng__because what we had before for - for uh speaker change detection did not include these overlaps .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__so the first thing is for you to - to build up something that will detect the overlaps .__c3
__qy^d^f^g^rt__yeah .__c2
__s__right ?__c3
__s.%--__so | again i think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh in - in - in - in ==__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__b__features .__c1
__s^df__well | i - again the things you've written up there i think are way too - way too big .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__okay if you're talking about say twelfth - twelfth order uh m f c c's or something like that it's just way too much .__c3
__s__you won't be able to look at it .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__b__all you'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does .__c3
__s^t^tc__yeah .__c2
__s^ba.%__whereas i think if you have things - if you pick one or two dimensional things or three of you have some very fancy display uh and look at how the - the different classes separate themselves out you'll have much more insight about what's going on .__c3
__s__it will be enough .__c2
__b__well you'll - you'll get a feeling for what's happening you know .__c3
__s__so if you look at - suppose you look at first and second order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first order is much more effective than the second and then you look at the third and there's not - and not too much there you may just take first and second order cepstral coefficients .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c2
__b.%__right ?__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__and with l p c i think l p c per se isn't going to tell you much more than - than - than the other maybe .__c3
__sj^ba__uh | and uh on the other hand the l p c residual the energy in the l p c residual will say how well uh the low order l p c model's fitting it which should be pretty poorly for two- - two or more people speaking at the same time and it should be pretty well for w- - for - for one .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c2
__s.%-__and so i - i- - again if you take a few of these things that are - are prob- - um promising features and look at them in pairs uh i think you'll have much more of a sense of okay i now have - uh doing a bunch of these analyses .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__i now have ten likely candidates .__c3
__qrr.%--__and then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__fh|s__yeah .__c2
__s^2__i've got a question .__c0
__b__interesting .__c4
__b__this- ==__c2
__s__huh .__c4
__s__sorry .__c2
__fg__but uh uh uh uh uh i don't know it is the first uh way to - to - do that .__c2
__s__and i would uh like to - to know what uh your opinion .__c2
__b__uh all this study in the f- - in the first moment i - i w- - i - i will pretend to do with uh uh equalizes speech the the equalizes speech the speech uh the mixes of speech .__c2
__fh__with ==__c1
__s__with what ?__c4
__s^bk__with what ?__c4
__qy^rt__right mixed .__c1
__qrr.%--__the the mix mixed speech .__c2
__s^na^rt__mixed | thank you .__c4
__s^aa__uh why ?__c2
__sj^ba^fe__because uh the spectral distortion is more uh a lot uh clearer very much clearer if we compare with the p d a .__c2
__s^bd__right .__c1
__s^ar__p d a speech file is uh it will be uh difficult .__c2
__s.%--__i ==__c2
__s__so it's messier .__c4
__s__the - the p d a is messier .__c4
__s^ar__yeah .__c2
__s__because the n- - the noise uh to sp- - the signal to noise relation is uh is - is low .__c2
__s__okay .__c3
__b__yeah i think that that's - a good way to start .__c1
__s.%--__and | i don't know .__c2
__s__but ==__c1
__s^aa__i don't know uh uh i- - i- - that uh - the the result of the - of the study uh with uh - with uh this uh this speech - the mix speech uh will work exactly with the uh p d a files .__c2
__s^aa__it would be interesting in itself to see .__c1
__s__uh what i - i mean what- - what is the effect of the low signal to - to - to noise relation you know uh with ?==__c2
__s.%--__well i think that would be an interesting result .__c1
__b__n- - u- - we- ==__c3
__s__well | i think - i think - i think it's not a - it's not at all unreasonable .__c3
__%-__it makes sense to start with the simpler signal .__c3
__s__because if you have features which don't - aren't even helpful in the high signal to noise ratio then there's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio one would think anyway .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__sj^ba^tc__and so if you can get @reject@ uh again my prescription would be that you would with a mixed signal you would take a collection of possible uh features look at them look at how these different classes that you've marked separate themselves and then collect uh in pairs and then collect ten of them or something and then proceed with a bigger classifier .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s.%-__yeah .__c2
__s^rt__and then if you can get that to work well then you go to the other signal .__c3
__s^rt__and then and you - and you know they won't work as well but how m- - you know how much .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__fg|s__right .__c1
__s__yeah yeah .__c2
__s__and then you can re optimize and so on .__c3
__fh__yeah but it- - i think it would be interesting to try a couple with both .__c1
__b__because it - i think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed and and don't .__c1
__fh__huh .__c3
__b__uh yeah yeah yeah yeah .__c2
__b.%__that's - well the - it - it's - it's true that it also it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases sure .__c3
__s^cs^rt__but ==__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__s^df__i - i - i - i think that the - the uh parameter we found uh uh worked with both uh speech file .__c2
__s^aa__that's good .__c4
__s^bk__but uh what is the - the - the relation of uh of the performance when uh you use uh - the uh uh speech file- - the p d a speech files ?__c2
__b__huh .__c3
__sj^ba__yeah i don't know .__c2
__b__right .__c3
__s.%--__but it - i - i - i - i think it will be important .__c2
__s^bd__because uh people uh uh different groups eh has uh experience with this uh kind of problem is uh is not easy uh to- - to solve because if you ==__c2
__s__i - i - i have seen the - the - the speech file from uh p d a and s- - some parts is very difficult .__c2
__s^df__because you - you don't see the spectrum - the spectrogram .__c2
__s.%--__right .__c1
__s__is very difficult to apply uh uh a parameter to detect change when you don't see .__c2
__s.%--__yeah they're totally hidden .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^m^na__well | that - that - that's another reason why very simple features things like energy and things - things like harmonicity and residual energy are uh yeah are - are better to use than very complex ones because they'll be more reliable .__c3
__s__but i suppose ==__c2
__s__are probably better yep .__c1
__s__yeah yeah yeah .__c2
__s^aap^rt__i - i - i will put uh the energy here .__c2
__qy^bu.%-__yeah yeah yeah .__c2
__s^am__ch- - chuck was going to ask something i guess .__c3
__qy^d^f^g^rt__you have a question ?__c2
__s__yeah | i maybe this is a dumb question .__c0
__s^bk__but w- - i thought it would be - i thought it would be easier if you used a p d a .__c0
__qy^d^f__nah .__c3
__s^bk__because can't you couldn't you like use beam forming or something to- - detect speaker overlaps ?__c0
__s__i mean ==__c0
__b__well if you used the array rather than the signal from just one .__c1
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c0
__s.%--__yeah no you- - you're - you're right .__c3
__s.%--__but that's ==__c1
__s.%--__that in fact if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones you do have some location information which we don't have with the one .__c3
__s.%--__and - and so that's ==__c3
__s__is that not allowed with this project ?__c0
__s__uh well | no i mean we- - we don't have any rules r- - really .__c3
__s^2__but i didn't mean - i w- - given - given the goal .__c0
__qy^d^f^g^rt__i think i - i think - i think it's - it's - it's a - it's an additional interesting question .__c3
__b__i mean is - is that violation of the ?==__c0
__s__oh .__c2
__b__no .__c2
__b__yeah .__c2
__sj^ba^df^rt__i mean i think you want to know whether you can do it with one .__c3
__s__because you know it's not necessarily true that every device that you're trying to do this with will have two .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__s^rt__yeah .__c2
__b__uh | if on the other hand we show that there's a huge advantage with two well then that could be a real point .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^bs__but we don't n- - even know yet what the effect of detecting - having the ability to detect overlaps is .__c3
__fh__you know maybe it doesn't matter too much .__c3
__s__right .__c0
__s__right .__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__fh__so this is all pretty early stages .__c3
__x__okay .__c0
__b.%__yeah .__c2
__s__but no you're absolutely right .__c3
__s^bd__yeah .__c2
__s^bd__i see .__c0
__s__yeah yeah yeah .__c2
__s.%--__that's a good thing to consider .__c3
__s__okay .__c0
__b__there - there is a complication though and that is if a person turns their back to the - to the p d a then some of the positional information goes away .__c4
__s__well it - it - it does i- - it d- - it does but the - the - the issue is that - that ==__c3
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s__no it's not - it's not that so much as ==__c0
__b__and then and if they're on the access on the axis of it that was the other thing i was thinking .__c4
__s^e__uhhuh .__c1
__b__he - you mentioned this last time that - that if - if you're straight down the midline then - then - the r- - the left right's going to be different .__c4
__s.%--__yeah we hav- - need to put it on a little turntable .__c1
__s^rt__i - i - i - i - i th- ==__c2
__s.%--__and ==__c1
__s__well it's- ==__c0
__b.%__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__and - and - and in his case i mean he's closer to it anyway .__c4
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^cs__it seems to me that - that it's not - a p- - uh you know it's - this - the topograph- - the topology of it is - is a little bit complicated .__c4
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__but it's another source of information .__c1
__s__i - i - yeah .__c2
__fh__i don't - i don't know ho- ==__c0
__b__i - i - i think ==__c2
__s__sorry .__c2
__fg__i - i - i think because the- - the- - the distance between the two microph- - uh microphone uh in the p d a is very near .__c2
__s__but it's uh from my opinion it's an interesting idea to - to try to study the binaural uh problem uh with information because i - i found difference between the - the speech from - from each micro- - uh in the p d a .__c2
__s^cs^df.%--__i would guess ==__c0
__s^bk__yep .__c1
__s__yeah it's timing difference .__c3
__s.%--__oh yeah oh i agree and we use it ourselves .__c4
__s^bk__it- - it's not amplitude .__c3
__s__right ?__c3
__s__s- - right .__c3
__s__i mean i know - i n- - i know that's a very important cue .__c4
__b__yep .__c1
__s^fe__yeah .__c2
__fh__but i'm just - i'm just saying that the way we're seated around a table is not the same with respect to each - to each person with respect to the p d a .__c4
__b__no .__c2
__s^bk|qw^rt__no .__c2
__fh__no no no .__c2
__s^cs__so we're going to have a lot of differences with ref- - respect to the speaker .__c4
__s^cs^df__that's - that's fine .__c3
__h__but th- - i don't think that matters though .__c0
__s^ng.%--__but ==__c2
__s^df__that's - so - so - i- - i think the issue is is there a clean signal coming from only one direction .__c3
__s^bk__right .__c0
__s^rt__if it's not coming from just one direction if it - if th- - if there's a broader pattern it means that it's more likely there's multiple people speaking .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__wherever they are .__c3
__fh__so it's sort of like how - how confused is it about where the beam is .__c0
__qy^rt__is it a - is it ?==__c3
__qrr__yeah is there a narrow - is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a - a distributed beam pattern ?__c3
__s^aa|s^na__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__so if there's a distributed beam pattern then it looks more like it's - it's uh multiple people .__c3
__h|qw.%-__okay .__c4
__s^fa^t3__wherever you are even if he moves around .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^rt__okay | it just - it just seemed to me that uh that this isn't the ideal type of separation .__c4
__fh__i mean i - i think it's i can see the value o- ==__c4
__s^rt__oh ideal would be to have the wall filled with them .__c3
__b__but i mean but the thing is just having two mikes if you looked at that thing on - on dan's page it was when - when there were two people speaking and it looked really really different .__c3
__s.%--__yeah okay .__c4
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__s^df__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^r__yep .__c1
__b__oh yeah yeah okay .__c4
__s__yeah .__c2
__b__what looked different ?__c0
__s__yeah .__c4
__fh|s^r__uh well basic- - he was looking at correlation .__c3
__qw^rt__cross co- - cross correlation .__c1
__s__just cross correlation between two sides .__c3
__s^bk^m__correlation yeah .__c2
__fh|s__so cross correlation is pretty sensitive .__c3
__fg__did- - sorry | b- - uh i'm not sure what dan's page is that you mean he was looking at the two ==__c0
__s__uh his a web page .__c4
__s^aa__you take the signal from the two microphones and you cros- - and you cross correlate them with different lags .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__subtract them .__c1
__s^aa^r__okay .__c0
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c4
__s__yeah .__c2
__%-__uhhuh .__c0
__s^co^tc__okay .__c3
__s^bk__and you find - they get peaks .__c1
__b__so when one person is speaking then wherever they happen to be at the point when they're speaking then there's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the l- - in - in the lag .__c3
__s^df__so if - at whatever angle you are at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there you get this boost in the - in - in the cross correlation value - function .__c3
__b__okay okay .__c0
__b__so - so if there's two ==__c0
__s.%--__and if there are multiple people talking you'll see two peaks .__c1
__b__it's spread out .__c3
__fh|s__well let me ask you if - if both people were over there it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across catty corner .__c4
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__b.%__yeah .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__fh__the- - the - oh i'm sorry .__c3
__s.%--__no ?__c4
__s__if they're right next to one another ?__c3
__s__if i was - if i was here and morgan was there and we were both talking it wouldn't work .__c0
__b__next - next one over n- - over on this side of the p- - p d a .__c4
__fh|s__i- - i- ==__c3
__b__there we go .__c4
__b__right .__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__good example the same one i'm asking .__c4
__b.%__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah e- - i see .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c2
__fh__versus you - versus - you know and we're catty corner across the table and i'm farther away from this one and you're farther away from that one .__c4
__s__yes .__c0
__b.%__or - or even if like if people were sitting right across from each other you couldn't tell the difference either .__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^cs__it seems like that would be pretty strong .__c4
__b__yeah oh yeah .__c3
__s^cs^e__yeah .__c2
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^e__across - the same axis you don't have as much to differentiate .__c4
__b__and so my point was just that it's - it's going to be differentially - differentially varia- - valuable .__c4
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s__well we d- - yeah we don't have a third dimension there yeah so it's ==__c3
__b__right .__c1
__s__i mean it's not to say i mean i certainly think it's extremely val- - and we - we humans n- - n- - depend on you know these - these binaural cues .__c4
__%--__yeah yeah .__c2
__b.%__but it's almost - but it's almost a - i think what you're talking about i- - there's two things .__c3
__s^cs__but .__c4
__s^df__must do yeah .__c1
__s__there's a sensitivity issue and then there's a pathological error uh issue .__c3
__b__so th- - the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a pathological error .__c3
__b__yes yeah .__c4
__fh__if someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it .__c3
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__b__okay .__c4
__s__and i- - and if there - so it - and if it's the two of you guys on the same side ==__c4
__b__uh if they're - if they're close it's just a question of the sensitivity .__c3
__b__yep .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c4
__b__okay .__c4
__s^cs.%--__so if the sensitivity is good enough - and we just - we just don't have enough uh experience with it to know how ==__c3
__s__yeah yeah okay yeah .__c4
__b__but ==__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__b^rt__oh i'm not - i'm not trying to argue against using it by any means i just wanted to point out that - that weakness that it's topo- - topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^aa__and i think dan is still working on it .__c1
__qw.%-__so | he actually he wrote me about it a little bit .__c1
__fh|qw.%--__so ==__c1
__s^am__great .__c4
__b__no i don't mean to discourage that at all .__c4
__s^rt__i mean the other thing you can do - uh if - i mean i- - we're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody - convince somebody to put two microphones in the p d a .__c3
__b__but if you h- - put a third in you could put in the other axis and then you know then you're sort of - yeah then - then you pretty much could cover ==__c3
__s__once you got two .__c0
__s^bk__interesting .__c4
__qy^rt__yeah .__c2
__fh__well what about just doing it from these mikes ?__c0
__s^ar__interesting .__c4
__s^cs__you know ?__c0
__s^ar__yeah .__c2
__s^ar^r__yep .__c1
__s^aa__it will be more interesting to study the p z m because the- - the - the separation - i - i think .__c2
__s^aa__uh @reject@ but- - but that's - i mean we can- - we'll be - all of this is there for us to study .__c3
__s^aa^r__then they're much broader .__c1
__s^aa__yeah we can do whatever we want .__c1
__s^df__yeah .__c2
__b__but - but - but the thing is uh one of the - at least one of the things i was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a p d a .__c3
__s^cs__whatever you're interested in .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__that's what i was asking about what are the constraints .__c0
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^ng__yeah .__c2
__b__right yeah .__c3
__b.%__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__%--__well that's - that's the constraint of one question that i think both adam and i were - were - were interested in .__c3
__fh__well ==__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__fg|s^arp.%-__yep .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__b__uh ==__c3
__%-__yeah .__c2
__s^am__but - you know if you can instrument a room this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing | right ?__c3
__fh__some people at - at - uh yeah at brown and - and - and - and - at uh um and at cape .__c3
__s__big micro @reject@ arrays .__c1
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^e__didn't they have something at cape ?__c0
__s^bk__they both have these you know big arrays on the wall .__c3
__fh__and you know if you could do that you've got microphones all over the place .__c3
__s^arp__very finely .__c1
__b__uh you know p- - tens of microphones .__c3
__b__and - and uh ==__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__oh i saw a demo !__c0
__%-__oh right oh yeah .__c2
__qy^bu^rt__and if you do that then you can really get very nice uh kind of selectivity .__c3
__qy__yeah .__c0
__qy^e.%--__oh i saw one that was like a hundred microphones a ten by ten array .__c1
__s^aa__yeah yeah .__c3
__s^aa__hundred .__c2
__b__and you could - in a noisy room they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody .__c0
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__and they had very precision ==__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__qy^bu^d.%-__right .__c1
__s.%--__ye- - pretty much yeah .__c3
__s^nd__very complex uh yeah .__c2
__s^bk__it was all in software and they - and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it .__c1
__s^no__yeah .__c3
__fh|s^df__that is cool .__c0
__%-__yeah .__c2
__s__it was yeah it was interesting .__c1
__fh__but | the reason why i haven't focused on that as the fir- - my first concern is because um i'm interested in what happens for people - random people out in some random place where they're p- - having an impromptu discussion .__c3
__s^bu__and you can't just always go well let's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to se- - to set up .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s^aa^rt__yeah .__c2
__s__no | what you need to do is you'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall .__c0
__s^na__it has all these mikes and it has a plug in jack to the p d a .__c0
__s.%-__interesting .__c4
__s^bu.%--__the other thing actually that gets at this a little bit of something else i'd like to do is what happens if you have two p d a's ?__c3
__s^aa__but i think ==__c1
__s__yep .__c1
__s^bk__and they communicate with each other and then - you know they're in random positions the likelihood that - i mean basically there wouldn't be any l- - likely to be any kind of nulls if you even had two if you had three or four it's - yeah .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s__ooo !__c0
__s__that's on my web pages .__c1
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__s.%--__network .__c0
__s^bs__interesting .__c4
__s^e__though ==__c1
__s__all sorts of interesting things you can do with that .__c1
__s^bk^rt__interesting .__c4
__s__i mean not only can you do microphone arrays but you can do all sorts of um multi band as well .__c1
__b__huh .__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__s^bk^rt__yeah .__c3
__s__uh !__c4
__s__so it's - it would be neat .__c1
__s^e__i still like my rug on the wall idea so if anybody patents that then ==__c0
__s^aa__but ==__c1
__s^cs__i think ==__c1
__s^aa__well you could have strips that you stick to your clothing .__c4
__b__in terms of ==__c1
__fg__yeah .__c1
__s^ba__yeah !__c0
__s^e__hats .__c0
__b__in terms of the research th- - research it's really - it's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do .__c1
__s__shirts .__c0
__s^co^t__so if - if jose is interested in that that's great .__c1
__fh__but if - if he's not that's great too .__c1
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s^cs.%--__yeah yeah .__c2
__b__um | i - i- - i - i- - i would actually kind of like us to wind it down see if we can still get to the end of the uh birthdays thing there .__c3
__s__catch some tea ?__c1
__s__um .__c1
__b__so ==__c3
__qy^rt__well i had a couple things that i did want to bring out .__c1
__qy^d^e^rt__okay .__c3
__s__one is do we need to sign new - these again ?__c1
__qy^rt__well it's slightly different so i - i would say it would be a good idea .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__because it - it's slightly different .__c4
__qy^d^rt__are they new ?__c0
__h__yep .__c1
__s^no__oh .__c0
__s__oh this morning we didn't sign anything because we said that if anybody had signed it already we didn't have to .__c3
__s__yeah i - i should've checked with jane first but the ch- - the form has changed .__c1
__s^am__it's slightly different .__c4
__s^bk__uhoh .__c3
__s^bk^r__so we may want to have everyone sign the new form .__c1
__s^e__okay .__c2
__%--__i had to make one ==__c4
__s^ba__um | i had some things i wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff i'm doing .__c1
__s__but if we're in a hurry we can put that off .__c1
__s^aa__um | and then also anonymity how we want to anonymize the data .__c1
__b__well should i - i mean i have some results to present but i mean i guess we won't have time to do that this time .__c4
__s^cs.%--__uh ==__c1
__s^aa__but it seems like um the anonymization is uh is also something that we might want to discuss in greater length .__c4
__s^aa__um | i mean wha- - what ?==__c3
__s__if - if we're about to wind down i think - what i would prefer is that we uh delay the anonymization thing till next week .__c4
__s^aa__and i would like to present the results that i have on the overlaps .__c4
__fh|s__we still have to do this too | right ?__c0
__s^na__right .__c3
__b__digits ?__c0
__fh|s__right .__c3
__b__no- - well we don't have to do digits .__c1
__s^aa__well why don't we ==__c3
__s^aa__uh so okay | @reject@ it sounds like u- - uh there were - there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about .__c3
__s__why don't we just take a couple minutes to to briefly do them and then - and then - and then - and then - and then we ==__c3
__s.%--__okay go ahead jane .__c1
__b__i'd - i'd prefer to have more time for my results .__c4
__b__e- - could i do that next week maybe ?__c4
__s^t3__okay .__c3
__fh__oh yeah sure .__c3
__s^e__okay that's what i'm asking .__c4
__b__oh yeah yeah .__c3
__fh__and i think the anonymization if y- - if you want to proceed with that now i just think that that's - that's a discussion which also n- - really deserves a lo- - a - you know more that just a minute .__c4
__s^tc__we could s- ==__c3
__fh__i really do think that .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__s__because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself .__c4
__fh__you and i have discussed it previously .__c4
__fh__and there are different ways that people approach it e- - and i think we should ==__c4
__s__all right .__c1
__s:qy__we're - we're just- - we're getting enough data now that i'd sort of like to do it now before i get overwhelmed with - once we decide how to do it .__c1
__s^aa__well okay .__c4
__s.%--:qw.%--__going and dealing with it .__c1
__s__it's just ==__c4
__s:qw__yeah okay i - i'll give you the short version .__c4
__qy^rt__but i do think it's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__s:qw__okay so - | the - the short thing is um we have uh tape recording - uh uh sorry digitized recor- - recordings .__c4
__fh__those we won't be able to change .__c4
__s__if someone says hey roger so-and-so .__c4
__b__right .__c1
__s__so that's going to stay that person's name .__c4
__b__yep .__c1
__fh__now in terms of like the transcript .__c4
__s__the question becomes what symbol are you going to put in there for everybody's name ?__c4
__s^cs__and whether you're going to put it in the text where he says hey roger or are we going to put that person's anonymized name in instead ?__c4
__b__no | because then that would give you a mapping and you don't want to have a mapping .__c1
__s^2__okay so first decision is we're going to anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker's name is mentioned .__c4
__s__no .__c1
__b__i don't ==__c0
__b__because that would give you a mapping between the speaker's real name and the tag we're using and we don't want ==__c1
__s.%--__i - i don't think you understood what i - what i said .__c4
__b__okay .__c1
__b__so - uh | so in - within the context of an utterance someone says so roger what do you think .__c4
__s.%--__okay .__c4
__s__then uh it seems to me that well maybe i - uh it seems to me that if you change the name the transcript's going to disagree with the audio and you won't be able to use that .__c4
__fh|s__we don't - we want to - we ha- - we want the transcript to be roger .__c1
__s__right | you don't want to do that .__c0
__s^2.%__because if we made the - the transcript be the tag that we're using for roger someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name and we want to avoid that .__c1
__b__yeah .__c0
__s__okay | well but then there's this issue of if we're going to use this for a discourse type of thing then - and you know liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who's - who's the addressee and all then to have roger be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was roger be frank that's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis .__c4
__s.%--__oh .__c1
__b__ugh .__c1
__s__that's a good point .__c1
__qw__now if you want to you know i mean in some cases i - i - i know that susan ervin tripp in some of hers uh actually did do uh um a filter of the s- - signal where the person's name was mentioned except .__c4
__s__BLEEPED__c0
__s__BLEEPED__c1
__s__BLEEPED__c2
__fh|s^cs.%--__BLEEPED__c3
__s.%--__BLEEPED__c4
__qw__BLEEPED__c9
__qr^d__and - and i - cer- - and i - so i mean the question then becomes one level back .__c4
__qw__um how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name ?__c4
__qw__well | on the one hand uh it's not a full identity .__c4
__b__we're taking all these precautions um and they'll be taking precautions which are probably even the more important ones to - they'll be reviewing the transcripts to see if there's something they don't like okay .__c4
__s^e__so maybe uh maybe that's enough protection .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__on the other hand this is a small - this is a small pool and people who say things about topic x e- - who are researchers and well known in the field they'll be identifiable and simply from the - from the first name .__c4
__s^aa__however taking one step further back they'd be identifiable anyway even if we changed all the names .__c4
__qw__right .__c1
__qy__so is it really um - you know ?==__c4
__s^df__huh .__c2
__%-__ugh !__c1
__s^na__now | in terms of like - so i - i did some results which i'll report on n- - next time which do mention individual speakers by name .__c4
__%-__uhhuh .__c1
__s^e__now there the human subjects committee is very precise .__c4
__s^e__you don't want to mention subjects by name in published reports .__c4
__s__now it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a - in a study and just change everybody's name for the purpose of the publication .__c4
__b__yeah once you get to the publication you can certainly do that .__c3
__s__and someone who looked ==__c4
__b__you can go - you know uh z - uh for instance .__c3
__b__yeah exactly .__c4
__s__doesn't matter if ==__c4
__fg|%-__uh um yeah | i mean t- - it doesn't i mean i'm not knowledgeable about this .__c3
__s__that's the same thing you saw .__c4
__s__but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone's first name in - in the - in the transcript .__c3
__fg|s^cs__okay .__c1
__fh__@reject@ .__c1
__%-__uh | i think - you don't want to have their full name to be uh listed .__c3
__b.%__yeah | and - and in the form that they sign it does say your first name may arise in the course of the meetings .__c4
__s^aa__and so ==__c3
__s^rt__yeah .__c1
__s^na__well ==__c0
__b__yeah .__c3
__fh|s.%-__so again th- - the issue is if you're tracking discourse things you know if someone says uh uh frank said this and then you want to connect it to something later you've got to have this part where that's frank colon .__c3
__s^2__or your name .__c4
__s^rt__yeah shoot !__c1
__s^aa__right ?__c3
__s^aa__yeah and - and - you know even more i- - i- - uh - immediate than that just - being able to uh well it just seems like to track - track from one utterance to the next utterance who's speaking and who's speaking to whom because that can be important .__c4
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c1
__qy^rt__s- - i- - you know you raised the point so-and-so it's be kind of nice to be able to know who you was .__c4
__qy^rt__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__shoot !__c1
__s^aa^r__i - i'm thinking too much .__c1
__s^bk__and ac- - and actually you remember furthermore you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know i was sort of avoiding mentioning people's names .__c4
__fh__yeah i was too yeah .__c3
__s__and - and it was - and we made the decision that was kind of artificial .__c4
__s^co__well i mean if we're going to step in after the fact and change people's names in the transcript we've basically done something one step worse .__c4
__s__yep .__c1
__s^co__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__b.%__well i would sug- - i - i - don't want to change the names in the transcript .__c1
__b__misleading .__c4
____but that's because i'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse and so i think that's a really good point .__c1
____yeah .__c3
____you're right | this is going to require more thought .__c1
____yeah .__c3
____l- - let me just back up this to make a - a brief comment about the uh what we're covering in the meeting .__c3
____uh i realize when you're doing this that uh i mean i didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about .__c3
__%--__uh and so uh | and so i was proceeding some- - somewhat at random frankly .__c3
