__z__yeah .__c1
__z__okay we're on .__c0
__z__so i think this is going to be a pretty short meeting because i have four agenda items .__c0
__z__three of them were requested by jane who is not going to be at the meeting today .__c0
__z__tsk .__c0
__z__so | the uh - first was transcription status .__c0
__z__does anyone besides jane know what the transcription status is ?__c0
__z__um - | sort of i do peripherally .__c5
__z__um - | well first of all with i b m i got a note from brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a week or week and a half ago .__c5
__z__is that english ?__c2
__z__that's our system .__c3
__z__ugh !__c0
__z__and that it's gone out to the transcribers .__c5
__z__and hopefully next week we'll have the transcription back from that .__c5
__z__um - | jane seems to be um - moving right along on the transcriptions from the icsi side .__c5
__z__c- - can i have a pen ?__c0
__z__she's assigned i think probably five or six m- - more meetings .__c5
__z__yeah i think we're up to m r thirteen or something .__c2
__z__yeah | so um - i guess she's hired some new transcribers .__c5
__qy^rt__huh .__c3
__h|s^ng__and ==__c5
__qy^d^rt__which meetings is she transcribing ?__c4
__s^bk|s__speaking ==__c3
__fg__um - | well we've - we've run out of e d us because a certain number of them are um - sort of awaiting to go to i b m .__c5
__s^co^df__okay .__c4
__s.%__for i b m yeah .__c2
__s^bd__okay .__c4
__s^aa__huh .__c3
__s^bk__and the rest are in process being transcribed uh - here .__c5
__z__so we're doing some in parallel .__c4
__fh|s__so does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there's no data back from i b m ?__c3
__%--__yep .__c0
__qy^d^g.%__no .__c5
__s__oh no no .__c5
__fh|s^t^tc__no no .__c0
__fh__no .__c5
__s__no ?__c3
__fh__we're not waiting on them .__c5
__s__we haven't done that process .__c0
__s^bk__so they'r- - they're doing the full transcription process .__c0
__s^t__oh .__c3
__fh|s^bs__oh okay .__c3
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__so they're just doing their own thing until ==__c4
__s__because i - i need to ask jane whether it's - it would be okay for her um - s- - some of her people to transcribe uh - some of the initial data we got from the smartkom data collection which is these short like five or seven minute sessions .__c3
__s^cc__we're doing it in parallel yeah .__c5
__qy^d^rt__okay .__c4
__h|s__yep .__c2
__s^bk__um - and we want it - you know we need ==__c3
__%__the - again we - we have a similar uh - logistic set up where we are supposed to send the data to munich .__c3
__b__and get it transcribed and get it back .__c3
__s.%--__right .__c0
__fh__but to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started .__c3
__fh|s^cc__yep sounds familiar .__c0
__fh|qo^d^rt__and so um - i wanted to ask jane if - if uh - you know maybe one of their transcribers could - could do ==__c3
__s^ar__i mean since these are very short that should really be uh ==__c3
__fh__uhhuh .__c1
__qw^rt^tc__um - it's ==__c3
__h__there's only two channels .__c2
__sj__so it's only ==__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__it's only two ==__c3
__s^cc__yeah .__c2
__s__as the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed i think .__c2
__fh|qo^d^rt__right s- ==__c3
__qo^d__so ==__c2
__fh|s^tc__yeah .__c3
__s^co.%-__so - so it's basically one channel to transcribe .__c3
__qy^rt__and it's ==__c3
__s__one session is only uh - like seven ==__c3
__s__so that should have ma- - many fewer ==__c1
__h|s^co__and it's also not uh - a bunch of interruptions with people and all that .__c1
__s^bk__right .__c3
__b__and some of it is read speech so we could give them the - the thing that they're reading .__c3
__fg__right ?__c1
__s^bs^t^tc__so ==__c1
__s^bk|qh^co^t__yeah .__c1
__s^df__and they just may ==__c3
__s^cc__make sure it's right ?__c0
__sj^fe__and so um ==__c3
__qr__yep .__c2
__s__um - | i guess since she's ==__c3
__s^ft__i was going to ask her but since she's not around i - maybe i'll ==__c3
__s__yeah | well it certainly seems ==__c1
__s^bk__uh if - if that's okay with you to - to you know get that stuff uh - to ask her for that then i'll do that .__c3
__qy^2^d^rt__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__yeah if we're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that that's okay because i - i - um - i mean i still have high hopes that the - that the i b m pipeline will work out for us so it's ==__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__okay yeah .__c3
__s__yeah .__c1
__s.%--__alrighty .__c3
__s__oh | yeah and also related to the transcription stuff .__c5
__s__so i've been trying to keep a web page uh - up to date f- - showing what the current status is of the trans- - of all the things we've collected .__c5
__b__and what stage each meeting is in in terms of whether it's ==__c5
__s__can you mail that out to the list ?__c0
__fh|s__uhhuh yeah i will .__c5
__fh__i ==__c5
__s.%--__that's the thing that i sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages .__c5
__s__and so that's where i'm putting it but i'll ==__c5
__s__oh okay okay .__c0
__s__i'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .__c5
__qw__yeah i haven't done that .__c0
__s^bk__so i have lots of stuff to add that's just in my own directory .__c0
__s__yeah .__c5
__b__i'll try to get to that .__c0
__s__okay .__c0
__b__so jane also wanted to talk about participant approval but i don't really think there's much to talk about .__c0
__b__i'm just going to do it .__c0
__b__and uh - if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead .__c0
__s__you are going to ?==__c1
__s^e__i'm going to send out to the participants uh - with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits .__c0
__s^no__and then bleep them out .__c0
__s__okay .__c1
__s__for the ones that we have .__c0
__s__um ==__c0
__s__so but it's just transcripts not the - not the audio ?__c2
__b__nope | they'll have access to the audio also .__c0
__b__okay yeah yep .__c2
__s__uh ==__c2
__s.%--__i mean that's my intention .__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__because the transcripts might not be right .__c0
__s__so ==__c5
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__s^fa__so you want people to be able to listen to them .__c0
__s__so um - the audio that they're going to have access to will that be the uncompressed version ?__c5
__b__or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and ?==__c5
__b__oh that's a good point .__c0
__s__that's a good point .__c0
__qr.%-__yeah | it's - it's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because uh - uh - it takes too long to do random access decompression .__c0
__s__huh .__c5
__s__yeah i was just wondering because we're uh - running out of the un backed up disk space on ==__c5
__s^aa__well that was the other point .__c0
__s^aa__oh was that another one ?__c5
__b__yep that's another agenda item .__c0
__b__okay .__c5
__s^t1.%-__i'll wait .__c5
__s^na__so uh ==__c0
__s__but that is a good point so we'll get to that too .__c0
__s.%--__um - | darpa demo status not much to say .__c0
__qw__the back end stuff is working out fine .__c0
__s__it's more or less ready to go .__c0
__s__i've added some stuff that uh - indes- - indexes by the meeting type m r e d u et cetera .__c0
__s__and also by the user i d .__c0
__s^j__so that the front end can then do filtering based on that as well .__c0
__s^ar|s^nd__uh - | the back end is uh - going more slowly as i s- - i think i said before just because i'm not much of a tcl t. k. programmer .__c0
__fg__and uh - | dave gelbart says he's a little too busy .__c0
__s^aa.%__so i think don and i are going to work on that and - and you and i can just talk about it off line more .__c0
__b__right .__c4
__%--__but uh - | the back end was pretty smooth .__c0
__b__oh .__c1
__s^aa__so i think we'll have something .__c0
__s^aa__it may not be as - as pretty as we might like but we'll have something .__c0
__b__i wondered whe- - when we would reach dave's saturation point .__c1
__s__he's sort of been - been volunteering for everything .__c1
__s^t3__and - and uh ==__c1
__s.%-__yeah .__c0
__s.%-__uhhuh .__c3
__s__okay !__c1
__s^t3__finally said he was too busy .__c1
__s^aa|s__i guess we reached it .__c1
__s__yeah | he - he actually - he volunteered but then he s- - then he retracted it .__c0
__s^df.%--__so ==__c0
__b__oh well .__c0
__%--__um ==__c0
__s|s^cs__and also um - | i was just showing andreas i got um - an x waves kind of display .__c4
__s__and i don't know how much more we can do with it .__c4
__b__with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom .__c4
__s^bk__oh cool .__c0
__s^bk^r__so right now it's just an x waves .__c4
__s^df__and then you have three windows .__c4
__b__but i don't know it looked pretty nice .__c4
__b__and i'm sure it - think it has potential for a little something .__c4
__s__for a demo ?__c0
__s__yeah for a demo .__c4
__s__yeah sounds good .__c0
__s__so ==__c4
__s^e__okay | so again the issue is - for july the issue's going to be what can we fit into a windows machine uh - and so on .__c1
__b__oh .__c4
__s.%--__but ==__c1
__sj^fe__okay .__c4
__sj^fe.%__so it might just be slides .__c0
__s__yeah okay .__c4
__b__well we'll see um ==__c4
__s^j__well - yeah .__c2
__s__i've been putting together uh - transcriber things for windows .__c2
__s__so i- ==__c2
__s__and i installed it on dave gelbart's p c and it worked just fine .__c2
__s__so hopefully that will work .__c2
__s^e__really ?__c3
__s.%--__so is that ?==__c3
__s^bd__because there's some people um ==__c3
__s__it would be cool if we could uh - get that to work uh - at - at s r i .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__because the um ==__c3
__s__yep .__c2
__fh|s__we have m- - m- - we have more windows machines to run the ==__c3
__s.%--__well transcriber is tcl t. k. very generic with snack .__c0
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^df^rt__so basically anything you can get snack to run on it will work .__c0
__s^df^e__right .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__but - but the problem is the version transcriber works with the snack version is one point six whatever .__c2
__s__and that's not anymore supported .__c2
__s__it's not on - on the web page anymore .__c2
__s__but i just wrote an email to - to the author of - to the snack author .__c2
__s__and he sent me to one point six whatever - library .__c2
__s__and so it works .__c2
__b__well i thought it was packaged with transcriber .__c0
__sj^fe__yeah .__c2
__s^bk|sj^ba__but then you can't add our patches .__c2
__fh__and then the - the new version is - is totally different .__c2
__b__oh .__c0
__s__a- - and in - yeah in terms of - of the source code .__c2
__s__you - you can't find the tcl files anymore .__c2
__s^rt__uh .__c0
__s^t3__it's some whatever - wrapped thing .__c2
__s^rt__huh .__c3
__s__and you can't - you can't access that .__c2
__s.%-__so you have to install - first install tcl then install snack .__c2
__%-__and then install the transcriber thing .__c2
__s.%-__and then do the patches .__c2
__b__patch .__c0
__s__i - i wonder if - if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along ==__c3
__qy^bu^d__ugh !__c0
__s.%-__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__s^bs__we have .__c0
__s^aa__we have ?__c3
__s__yeah | b- - it's just hasn't made it into the release yet .__c0
__s.%-__oh .__c3
__s^cs.%-__oh okay .__c3
__s^aa|s__so did you um - put the uh - the n t version out on the uh - meeting recorder page or ?==__c5
__s.%-__no i haven't done that yet .__c2
__s__i'm ==__c2
__b__oh nope .__c2
__fh.%__but i definitely will do that .__c2
__b__so can some of the stuff that don's talking about somehow fit into this ?__c1
__qw^rt__uh - | mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the ==__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__qw^rt__yeah it's basically ascii files or binary files whatever representation .__c4
__s^cc__so ==__c2
__s^cc__just three different ==__c4
__qy^d__it's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it's ==__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__i mean we could do it in matl- - i mean you could do it in a number of different places i'm sure .__c4
__s^ng__so - so - well ==__c3
__b__but - but it would be cool if the transcriber interface had like another window for the - you know maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is - that is you know time synchron- - ti- - ti- - time synchronous with the waveform .__c3
__s^na.%--__yep .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__yeah that'd be very cool .__c4
__s__yes .__c1
__%-__it'd be easy enough to add that .__c0
__s^aa__again it's - it's - it's more tcl t. k. programming .__c0
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__so someone who's familiar with tcl t. k. has to do it .__c0
__s^na__right .__c3
__%-__right .__c3
__b__but uh - it wouldn't be hard to do .__c0
__b__but it would almost be like having another waveform displayed .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__b__yep .__c0
__s__s- ==__c3
__b__yep .__c2
__s__right .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__fg|s.%--__yeah maybe we could l- - look into that .__c2
__%-__yeah .__c4
__s^cs.%__but it - it seems to me that - i c- ==__c0
__b__and ==__c2
__s__it doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary .__c0
__s^aa__so yo- - it seems to me you could do images .__c0
__b__um - | what do you mean by real time ?__c4
__s^ar__do you mean like ?==__c4
__s^cs__like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo .__c5
__s__okay .__c4
__s__is that what you mean ?__c5
__s__yeah jus- - yeah .__c0
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__it just seems to me jus- ==__c0
__s^bk__it would be cool to see it .__c4
__s.%--__it would be cool like to see - to hear it and see it .__c4
__s^t1__and to hear it .__c2
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__and see the pitch contours also .__c4
__s__yeah .__c2
__%-__yeah .__c2
__%--__sure | but i don't think - i - you can do all that just statically in powerpoint .__c0
__s__i think it would lose ==__c4
__s^cc__yeah i mean y- ==__c4
__b__just record the audio clip and show an image and i think that's ==__c0
__s^cs__right right .__c4
__b__i just thought if you meant slides i thought you meant like just like um - view graphs or something .__c4
__b__you know wh- ==__c1
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__so uh ==__c1
__b__no we're talking about on the computer .__c1
__qy^d^f^g__right .__c4
__fh|s__and - and um - | i think when we were talking about this before we had littl- - this little demo meeting .__c1
__qy__we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have .__c1
__s^ar__and the more live the better but uh - given the crunch of time we may have to retreat from it to some extent .__c1
__s^nd__so i think - for a lot of reasons i think it would be very nice to have this transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^aa|s^na.%--__so it'd be a good thing to get in there .__c1
__b__but ==__c1
__b__um - | anyway jus- - just looking for ways that we could actually show what you're doing uh - in - to people .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__fh__because a lot of this stuff particularly for communicator uh - certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th- - originally had t- - had to do with prosodics .__c1
__b__it'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s__huh .__c3
__qy^d^g__and the last i- - item on the agenda is disk issues yet again .__c0
__b__so we're doing okay on backed up .__c0
__s__we're - we're only about thirty per cent on the second disk .__c0
__b__so uh - we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical .__c0
__b__but we are like ninety five per cent ninety eight per cent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings .__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__%__and my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space .__c0
__b__but unfortunately we're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once in a lot of different ways .__c0
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__oh there's a lot of transcribers too .__c5
__s__yeah | there're a lot of transcribers .__c0
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__so all of those need to be expanded .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__b__and then people are doing chunking and i want to do uh - uh - uh - the permission forms .__c0
__s__an- ==__c2
__s__right .__c5
__s^cc__so i want those to be live so there's a lot of data that has to be around .__c0
__s^aa__um - | and jane was going to talk to uh - dave johnson about it .__c0
__s__one of the things i was thinking is we - we just got these hundred ==__c0
__b__all right excuse me .__c0
__s__ten uh - sparc blade sun blades .__c0
__sj^ba__did they come in ?__c1
__sj^ba^r__sun blades .__c5
__b__yeah .__c5
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__they came in the other day .__c5
__sj__they came in but they're not set up yet .__c0
__s.%--__oh .__c1
__b__and so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they'll be in the machine room .__c0
__sj__they'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines .__c0
__s^aa__and if we just need un backed up space we could just hang disks off them .__c0
__s^aa__well is there ?==__c5
__s__why not just hang them off of abbott ?__c5
__s^rt__is there a ?==__c5
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__because there's no more room in the disk racks on abbott .__c0
__b__uh .__c5
__b__uh i see .__c5
__s__weren't we going to get ?==__c1
__s__well maybe it should get another rack .__c1
__fg|s__but you still need to store the disks somehow .__c3
__fh__well but the sun blades have spare drive bays .__c0
__s^df__so ==__c3
__b__you can put two ==__c5
__s.%-__just put them in .__c0
__s^ar__oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the ?==__c3
__s__internal .__c2
__s.%--__sure .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__oh .__c3
__b__because the sun - uh - these sun blades take commodity hard drives .__c0
__s__so you can just go out and buy a p c hard drive and stick it in .__c0
__s^cc__huh .__c3
__s.%-__but if abbott is going to be our disk server it - it - file server it seems like we would want to get it uh - a second disk rack or something .__c1
__s__plus we're talking about buying a second dis- - uh - file server .__c3
__s__well i mean there are lots of long term solutions .__c0
__s__what i'm looking for is where do we s- - expand the next meeting ?__c0
__s__yep .__c2
__s__i see oh i see .__c3
__s__well for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten .__c1
__s__mightn't you ?__c1
__b__uh - | you know dave johnson is gone for like ten days .__c1
__s__oh i didn't know he had left already .__c0
__b__uh - | well tonight .__c1
__s__oh oh well .__c0
__s__you mean he won't set up the ?==__c3
__b__huh .__c3
__s__how much space do you need for these ?__c4
__s__i don't know .__c1
__sj^ba__i don't know what his schedule is .__c1
__s__you - we need about a gig per meeting .__c0
__fh__i'm just saying he's gone .__c1
__s^arp__i - i thi- ==__c5
__qy.%-__yep .__c2
__s__i have um - i have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer .__c4
__fg__all right !__c0
__qy^rt__so ==__c4
__s.%-__what's your computer's name ?__c0
__s.%--__uh - | samosa .__c4
__s^na.%--__you had an eighteen gigabyte drive .__c1
__s__yeah i had .__c4
__b__well it's about - i think there's about twelve gig left .__c4
__s__so it - and you have an x drives installed ?__c0
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__okay .__c0
__b__so | i didn't realize it was so critical .__c4
__s__and you're o- - you're offering ?==__c0
__b__i mean i'm not doing anything on it right now until i get new meetings to transcri- - or that are - new transcriptions coming in i really can't do anything .__c4
__s__okay .__c0
__s__i - i jus- - i just gave thilo some - about ten gigs the last ten gigs of space that there was on - on uh - abbott .__c5
__fg|s^ng__um - not that i can't do anything i jus- ==__c4
__fh|s.%-__uh - and uh ==__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__so but that - but ==__c5
__s__which one was that ?__c0
__s.%--__x g ?__c0
__s__x g .__c2
__s^aa__x g .__c5
__s^na__okay .__c0
__s__yeah .__c5
__s.%--__x g ?__c3
__b__that's also where we store the - the uh - hub five training set waveforms .__c3
__s__oops .__c2
__s__no .__c5
__fg|s^df__right ?__c3
__b__but that won't be getting any bigger .__c0
__s__i don't think that's on x g .__c5
__s^am__will it ?__c0
__s.%--__right .__c3
__s^am^r__on x g is only carmen and du- - and stephane's disk .__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__it's ==__c2
__s__but i've also been storing - i've been storing the feature files there .__c3
__h|s__yeah .__c2
__fh__and i guess i can s- - start deleting some because we now know what the best features are .__c3
__s^no__well ==__c4
__s__and we won't be using the old ones anymore .__c3
__sj__yeah i do- - i don't think it was on x g .__c5
__s.%--__i have a lot of space though .__c4
__s__uh - oh thats x. a - oh that's x ==__c3
__s^co__isn't that x h ?__c2
__b__i th- ==__c5
__s__i have a lot of space and it's not - it's n- ==__c4
__b__not - not for long .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__there's very little uh ==__c4
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__not for long .__c4
__s__but i mean it's not going f- ==__c4
__fh|s__maybe i'm confu- ==__c3
__s__oh no i'm sorry .__c3
__s^aa__it's not being used often at all .__c4
__s__but i'm using x h - h too .__c2
__s__yeah it's probably - probably only about four gig is on x - on your x drive .__c0
__s^df__so ==__c2
__s.%--__oh okay .__c3
__s^bk__but we'll definitely take it up if you ==__c0
__s.%--__i th- ==__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__i think you're right .__c3
__s__i think it's about four or five gig .__c4
__s^bk__it's x h and d ==__c3
__s^df__because i have four meetings on there .__c4
__s.%-__the b- ==__c3
__s__i'm also using d g .__c3
__s__i got that confused .__c3
__b__three or four meetings .__c4
__sj__okay - k .__c3
__s^bk__great .__c0
__s^aa__so ==__c4
__s__we need ==__c1
__s__okay so that will get us through the next couple days .__c0
__s^aa__we need another gigaquad .__c1
__s^aa^r__yep .__c0
__s__at least .__c0
__s^df__there should - i d- - there should just be a b- - i should have a button .__c1
__s__just press - press each meeting saying we need more disk space this week .__c1
__b__the more disk space button ?__c0
__s__yep .__c0
__s__skip the rest of the conversation .__c1
__s__well we've collected so far something like uh - sixty five meetings .__c5
__b__and it's about a gig uncompressed .__c5
__s__and - and how much does each meeting take ?__c1
__fg|s__it's - it's a little bit more as i usually don't - do not uncompress the - all of the p z m and the p d a things .__c2
__fg__is a little more ?__c5
__%-__right | yeah so if you uncompressed everything it's even more .__c5
__%-__so ==__c2
__s^aa__it's ==__c2
__b__yeah .__c2
__b__one point five or something .__c2
__s__u- - uh compressed how much are they ?__c5
__s__like ==__c5
__b__half a gig .__c0
__b__about half ?__c5
__s__for all of them .__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__yep .__c2
__b__so we're definitely are storing you know all of those .__c5
__s__so there's what ?__c5
__s__thirty some gig of just meetings so far ?__c5
__fg__so - so - so maybe there's a hundred gig or something .__c1
__b__or ==__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__i mean because we - we have the uncompressed around also .__c1
__s^e__right .__c5
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__so it's like ==__c1
__s__right .__c5
__s__well we - we haven't uncompressed all the meetings .__c5
__sj__but ==__c5
__s__i would like to .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__b__well i mean it's - the- - they really are cheap .__c1
__s^df__i mean it's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them .__c1
__%-__right .__c5
__sj__yep .__c0
__sj__but - but uh - we could - you know if you want to get four disks get four disks .__c1
__s__i mean it's - it's small - i mean these things ar- - are just a few hundred dollars .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c5
__s^bk__well i sent that message out to i guess you and dave asking for - if we could get some disk .__c5
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__i s- - i sent this out a - a day ago .__c5
__b__and put it where ?__c0
__s^cs__right .__c1
__s.%-__but - and dave didn't respond so i don- - i don't know how the whole process works .__c5
__b__i mean does he just go out and get them and - if it's okay and ?==__c5
__s__yep .__c0
__s.%--__so i was assuming he was going to take over that .__c5
__fg__but he's probably too busy given that he's leaving .__c5
__s__yeah i think you need a direct conversation with him .__c1
__s__and just say an e- - just ask him that you know wha- - what should you do .__c1
__s^na__and in my answer back was are you sure you just want one .__c1
__s__so i mean i think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure well here's what we pi- - figure on doing for the next few months .__c1
__s^t3.%--__yeah .__c5
__qy^r^rt__wa- - a- - i know what they want .__c0
__s^co^t3__the sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine .__c0
__qrr.%--__yeah .__c1
__s__so they don't want to stack up external drives .__c0
__s^aa__um - | and then they want everything else in the machine room .__c0
__s^t3__right .__c1
__b__so the question is where are you going to hang them ?__c0
__s^ft^t3__uhhuh .__c5
__s__i don't know what the space situation is in the machine room .__c5
__s__right .__c0
__b__so ==__c5
__b__right .__c1
__s__so this is a question that's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave .__c1
__sj^fa|qw^rt__th- - the ==__c3
__s__i think part of the reason why dave can't get the - the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now .__c5
__qy^d^g^j__because it ==__c1
__fh|s.%--__one ==__c3
__b__huh .__c3
__s__yep .__c0
__s__one - one - on- - one thing to in- - to um - t- - to do when you need to conserve space is ==__c3
__qy^rt__so he has to re arrange a bunch of stuff .__c5
__s^na__i bet there are still some old uh - like nine gig disks uh - around .__c3
__s__and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks .__c3
__b__and - and you know recover the space .__c3
__b__yep .__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__no .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__i think dave - dave knows all these things of course .__c1
__b__right .__c3
__sj^cs__an- - and so he always has a- - a lot of plans of things that he's going to do to make things better in many ways an- - and runs out of time .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__b__but i - i know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk .__c0
__sj__and so i think what he's been concentrating on is uh - the back - the back up system rather than on new disk .__c0
__fg__huh .__c3
__b__huh .__c3
__s^na__so ==__c0
__b__well .__c1
__s^bk__so ==__c1
__s__which ==__c0
__s__but this - this is a very specific question for me .__c1
__fh|s__basically we can easily get one to four disks .__c1
__b__i mean you just go out and get four and we've got the money for it .__c1
__s^j^t3__it's no big deal .__c1
__b__uh - | but the question is where they go ?__c1
__sj^cs__and i don't think we can solve that here .__c1
__b__maybe we can put some disks in the - in that back room there .__c3
__s^j__you just have to ask him .__c1
__b__yeah really .__c0
__b__attach to ==__c1
__s^ng__popcorn .__c0
__b__to the machine that collects the data .__c3
__s^nd__yeah .__c1
__s^nd__so then you could at least temporarily store stuff there .__c3
__s^bk__the only ==__c3
__b__huh .__c5
__fg|s^df^nd__yeah it's just - it's not on the net so it's a little awkward .__c0
__s^2__what do you mean it's not on the net ?__c3
__b__it's not ==__c0
__s__it's not bad .__c2
__s__it's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except s s h .__c0
__s^na__oh because it's - because it's an aciri machine ?__c3
__s^aa__yep .__c0
__s^aa__oh oh oh .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c1
__qw^d__and also on the list is to get it into the normal icsi net .__c0
__s^aa__but who knows when that will happen ?__c0
__s.%-__that might be a good short term solution though .__c5
__s.%-__but that can't be that hard .__c3
__fg|s^j__i mean ==__c3
__s__no the - the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the icsi routers .__c0
__b__oh ==__c3
__s.%-__so they actually have to run a wire somewhere .__c0
__fg|s__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah e- - again you know any one of these things is certainly not a big deal .__c1
__fh__if there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it's - it's - jus- - every- - ever- - everybody - everybody has a - has ==__c1
__fh__but dave has to do all of them .__c0
__fh__well all of us have long lists of different things we're doing .__c1
__s__but at any rate i think that there's a - there's a longer term thing and there's immediate need .__c1
__b__and i think we need a - a conversation with ==__c1
__s__uh - | maybe - maybe after - after tea or something you and i can go down and - and talk to him about it .__c1
__qy^d^g__just say wha- - you know what should we do right now .__c1
__s__how long is david going to be gone ?__c5
__qy^cs__uh - | eleven days or something .__c1
__s^t3__oh my !__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^ng__basically tomorrow and all of the week after .__c1
__s^arp__and that's all i have .__c0
__s__um ==__c1
__b__let's see .__c1
__s__the only oth- - thing - other thing i was going to add was that um - uh - i talked briefly to mari .__c1
__b__and uh - we had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here .__c1
__fh|s__but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the friday after next .__c1
__s__and i - i - i wanted to make it um - after the next one of these meetings .__c1
__b__so something that we want to do next meeting is - is uh - to put together um - a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it um - that we've done .__c1
__fh__i mean just sort of bulletize i mean o- - e- - do- - do- - i can - i can dream up text but this is basically going to lead to the annual report .__c1
__s^nd__so um - | if w- ==__c1
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c3
__b__this is the fifteenth ?__c0
__s__um - | that would ==__c1
__b__so just a week from tomorrow ?__c0
__s^2^aa__yeah .__c1
__s^na__okay .__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__%-__so uh - | we can ==__c1
__b__this ==__c1
__s__is this got to be in the morning ?__c3
__s^na__so that's an ==__c1
__b__um ==__c1
__s__or ==__c3
__qy^d^g__because you know i - fridays i have to leave uh - like around uh - two .__c3
__s^aa|s.%--__so if it could be before that would be be ==__c3
__b__no no but i - i - i don't need other folks for the meeting .__c1
__b__i can do it .__c1
__s__oh okay all right .__c3
__b__a- - a- - all i'm saying is that on ==__c1
__b__oh i'm sorry i misunderstood .__c3
__s__i thought you are ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__so what i meant was on the me- - this meeting if i wa- - something i - i - i'm making a major thing in the agenda is i want to help in getting together a list of what it is that we've done so i can tell her .__c1
__fg|qo__okay .__c3
__fh__all right .__c3
__qy__uhhuh .__c3
__s__okay .__c3
__s^co__i think i have a pretty good idea .__c1
__s__but - but um ==__c1
__s__uh - and then the next day uh - late in the day i'll be having that - that discussion with her .__c1
__b__huh .__c3
__s__um - so ==__c1
__b__um - uh - | one thing - i mean we - in past meetings we had um - also a- - you know various - variously talked about the um - work that w- - uh - was happening sort of on the - on the recognition side .__c3
__s__um - | but isn't necessarily related to meetings uh - specifically .__c3
__s^df__uhhuh .__c1
__s__so um - and i wondered whether we should maybe have um - a separate meeting .__c3
__s^e__and between you know whoever's interested in that .__c3
__b__because i feel that uh - there's plenty of stuff to talk about .__c3
__fh__but it would be sort of um - maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if uh ==__c3
__s__think so ?__c1
__s__well it's that it's just going to be ver- - very boring for people who are not you know sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system .__c3
__s^2__i'm interested .__c0
__b__me too .__c2
__b__well | okay so how many - how many people here would not be interested in uh - in a meeting about recognition ?__c1
__fh__jane may not be .__c5
__s__jane i think .__c0
__s__well i know - well jane an- ==__c3
__s^bk__yep .__c2
__qy.%--__well you mean in a separate meeting or ha- - talking about it in this ?==__c3
__s__no .__c0
__b__if we talked about it in this meeting .__c0
__s__he's wondering how much overlap there will be .__c5
__fh|s^cs__okay .__c3
__fh__yeah | so you're su- ==__c1
__qy^rt__so ==__c1
__s^ng__so ==__c3
__fh|s^ng__uh - uh ==__c3
__qy.%-__liz and jane probably .__c3
__b__okay | so we're going to have a guy's meeting .__c1
__s^ng__good thing liz isn't here .__c5
__fh__real ==__c1
__fg|s^cs__uh - if you want to put it that way .__c3
__b__watch a ball game ?__c4
__s^fe^t3__yeah real - real - real men - real men do decoding or something like that .__c1
__b__don't listen to this liz .__c5
__s__right .__c3
__s__uh ==__c1
__sj__i mean it- - it's sort of - i mean when - when the talk is about data collection stuff sometimes i've - you know i - i'm bored .__c3
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^co^j__the nod off ?__c0
__fg|s^cs^j__so it's i c- - i can sympathize with them not wanting to - to - to be uh - you know if i cou- - you know this could ==__c3
__b__it's because y- - you have a ==__c1
__s^co^j__so you need a better developed feminine side .__c1
__fg|%--__heh !__c3
__%__i'm not sure i want to ==__c3
__b__there's probably going to be a lot of bleeps in this meeting .__c1
__s^co^j__yeah i would as- - i would guess .__c0
__s^j__uh - um ==__c1
__s.%-__yeah .__c3
__fg|s__and ==__c3
__qy^rt__i think it must be uh - nearing the end of the week .__c1
__h|s^nd__um - | yeah .__c1
__s.%--__i - you know i - i've heard some comments about like this .__c1
__fh__that m- - could be .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__b__i mean the ==__c1
__s^ng__um - | u- ==__c1
__s__and we don't have to do it every week .__c3
__qw^rt__could we ?==__c5
__s__we could do it every other week or so .__c3
__s.%-__right | i was ==__c5
__s^cs^ng__you know whatev- - or whenever we feel like we ==__c3
__s.%-__why don't we alternate this meeting every other week ?__c5
__b__or just alternate the focus .__c0
__b__tha- - that's what i mean .__c5
__sj__yeah so on even weeks have basic - on data .__c0
__s^cc__yeah .__c1
__b__we could do that yeah .__c3
__s^cc__yeah .__c5
__s__i - i - personally i'd - i'm not in favor of more meetings .__c3
__b__um - | because uh ==__c3
__s__right .__c1
__s__you know ==__c3
__qy^rt__i am .__c0
__s^ar__oh sor- ==__c0
__s^bk__but i do- - i don't - i mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on meeting recorder .__c5
__s__right .__c3
__s__so if we did that ==__c5
__s^bk__well except that we keep going for our full time .__c0
__s^arp__yep .__c2
__s^nd.%-__well | because we get into these other topics .__c5
__s^ng__yeah .__c4
__s^df__we feel - we feel obligated to collect more data .__c3
__s__yeah .__c0
__qw^d^rt__yeah .__c5
__b__ugh .__c0
__b__so if we could alternate the focus of the meeting ==__c5
__s__i don't .__c0
__s^cc__let's read digits and go .__c0
__b__why don't we just start with that ?__c1
__sj__and then if we find you know we're just not getting enough done there's all these topics not coming up then we can expand into another meeting .__c1
__s^arp__umm - okay .__c3
__s^co__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__but i - i think that's a great idea .__c1
__s^ng__uh - so uh - um - | let's chat about it with liz and jane when we get a chance see what they think and ==__c1
__s^cs.%-__uhhuh .__c3
__b__yeah | that would be good .__c5
__s^bk__i mean andreas and i have various talks in the halls .__c5
__b__and there's lots of things you know details and stuff that would i think people would be interested in .__c5
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s^cs__and i'd - you know where do we go from here kind of things and ==__c5
__s^t3__so it would be good .__c5
__s^df__yeah and you're - you're attending the uh - the front end meeting as well as the others so you have - you have probably one of the best ==__c1
__s^2__you and i i guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two .__c1
__b__bridge .__c0
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c3
__s^j__we are doing recognition in both of them .__c1
__s__so ==__c1
__s.%-__uhhuh .__c5
__s^j__right .__c3
__s.%-__uh ==__c1
__s.%--__so um ==__c3
__b__okay .__c0
__s__so - so we could talk a little bit about that now if - if there's some time .__c3
__s^j__no no that would be for next week .__c0
__qy^d^g__um - i jus- - so the latest result was that um ==__c3
__s^cs^t3__um - | yot i tested the uh - the sort of final version of the p l p configuration um - on development test data for - for this year's hub five test set .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s^aa__and the recognition performance was exactly and i mean exactly up to the - you know the first decimal same as with the uh - mel cepstra front end .__c3
__qy^d^rt__huh .__c0
__s__for both females and males ?__c5
__%__yes .__c3
__b__oh !__c5
__b__uh - well i- - there was a little bit of a ==__c3
__s^j__i- - overall .__c3
__s__they - they were - the males i think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__s__i mean definitely not significant .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__qy^d^g__uhhuh .__c5
__s__and then the really nice thing was that if - if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half per cent improvement .__c3
__b__wow .__c0
__s__so ==__c3
__s__just with rover ?__c0
__s^j.%--__t- - t- ==__c3
__s^j__with n best rover which is like our new and improved version of rover .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__s^j__which u- - actually uses the whole n best list from both systems to uh - c- - combine that .__c3
__s^t^tc__so except - i mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto regressive versus the cepstral truncation .__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__okay .__c1
__b__and the ==__c3
__s__but a per cent and a half .__c5
__s__that's ==__c5
__s__yeah it's pretty impressive .__c0
__s__and - and so uh - after i told the - my uh - colleagues at s r i about that you know now they definitely want to you know uh - have a ==__c3
__s__next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh - you know basically a- - at least the system combination .__c3
__qy^rt__um - | and you know why not ?__c3
__s^na__sure | why not ?__c1
__fh|s^na__uh - so ==__c3
__s^na^r__we clearly got to add a few more features though .__c0
__qw^rt__uh - | w- - what do you mean ?__c3
__qw^bu^rt__more features in the sense of front end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ?__c3
__qw^bu__no uh - front end features .__c0
__b__you know we did p l p and mel cepstra .__c0
__s.%-__let's you know try rasta and m s g and ==__c0
__s__oh i mean ==__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__b__well ==__c3
__s__right .__c3
__qw^d^rt__so we cou- ==__c3
__%-__yeah .__c3
__s__that's - the - the - the ==__c3
__qy^d^rt__there's one thing uh - i mean you don't want to overdo it because y- - every front end ==__c3
__s^aa__you know if you - you know you basically multiply your effort by n where n is a number of different systems .__c3
__fh__oh .__c5
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__s^br__and um ==__c3
__s__so - so one - one compromise would be to - only to have the - everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system .__c3
__s__and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems .__c3
__s__and combine the results and that's a fairly painless um - thing .__c3
__b__huh .__c1
__b__an- ==__c1
__s__do you think we'd still get the one and a half uh ?==__c5
__fh|s__so ==__c3
__fh|s__i - i think so .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower .__c3
__s__and so if ==__c3
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c5
__s^ar__you know maybe it's only one per cent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing .__c3
__s__so ==__c3
__s__um - jus- - you know just wanted to let you know that that's working out very nicely .__c3
__s__cool .__c0
__s.%--__and then we had some results on digits uh - with um ==__c3
__s__we - we ==__c3
__s__so this was uh - really - really sort of just to get dave going with his um - experiments .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s__and so uh ==__c3
__s__but as a result um - you know we were sort of wondering why is the hub five system doing so well on the digits .__c3
__fh|s__and the reason is basically there's a whole bunch of read speech data in the hub five training set .__c3
__s__right .__c1
__qw__right .__c0
__h|s^no__including digits i gather yeah .__c1
__s^no__and you c- ==__c3
__b__and ==__c3
__qy^rt__not all of ==__c3
__qy^rt__no it's actually - digits is only a maybe a fifth of it .__c3
__s^aa__the rest is - is read - is read timit data and uh - atis data and wall street journal and stuff like that .__c3
__fg|s__a fifth of it is how much ?__c1
__s__right .__c1
__s__but a fi- - a fifth is how much ?__c1
__s__a fifth would be maybe uh - two hours something .__c3
__s__yeah so i mean that's actually not that different from the amount of training that there was .__c1
__s__right .__c3
__s__but it definitely helps to have the other read data in there .__c3
__s__so ==__c1
__s__because we're doing ==__c3
__fh__oh yeah ?__c1
__s__w- ==__c1
__s.%--__you know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti- - uh - timit - uh - not timit uh - t i digits .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s__which is only what ?__c3
__s^aa__two hours something ?__c3
__s__right .__c1
__fg|s__i don't know .__c0
__%-__so - uh - more read speech data definitely helps .__c3
__fh|s__and you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty .__c3
__qy^br^d^rt__that's e- ==__c3
__h__yeah that was the interesting thing .__c1
__s__that was e- ==__c3
__qw^t1__because - because uh - it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better .__c1
__s.%-__right right .__c3
__s^br__but - but uh ==__c1
__qy.%-__right .__c3
__s.%-__well is there even more read speech data around ?__c5
__s__oh yeah .__c3
__s^aa__so we only - for the hub five training we're only using uh - a fairly small subset of the macrophone data base .__c3
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c5
__s__um - | so you could beef that up and probably do even better .__c3
__s__i could also put in uh - focus condition zero from hub four from broadcast news which is mostly prepared speech .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk__it's not exactly read speech but it's pretty darn close .__c0
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__s__right .__c3
__s__well i mean that's plenty of read speech data .__c3
__s__i mean wall street journal uh - take one example .__c3
__s__yeah .__c0
__s.%-__that's right .__c0
__qy^bu^d__but um ==__c3
__s^na__so you know that might be useful for the people who train the - the digit recognizers to - to use uh - something other than t i digits .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c0
__s^aa__well they been using timit .__c1
__b__okay .__c3
__b__that ==__c1
__s^na__uh - they - they uh - they experimented for a while with a bunch of different data bases with french and spanish and so forth because they're multi lingual tests .__c1
__s^na__uhhuh .__c3
__b__and - and uh - um - and actually the best results they got wa- - were uh - using timit .__c1
__s__huh .__c0
__s__uh - but uh - which - so that's what they're - they're using now .__c1
__s__huh .__c3
__b__but - but yeah certainly if we um ==__c1
__fh|s__if we knew what the structure of what we're doing there was .__c1
__b__i mean there's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh - noise robustness algorithms .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__so we don't know exactly which combination we're going to be going with .__c1
__s__once we know then - the trainable parts of it - it'd be great to run lots of - lots of stuff through .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__b__right .__c3
__s__well that was that .__c3
__s^cs__and then i th- - guess chuck and i had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh - system .__c3
__b__and you want to - you want to see where that stands ?__c3
__fg|s^ng__well i'm ==__c5
__b__yeah so andreas uh - brought over the uh - alignments that the s r i system uses .__c5
__b__@reject@ .__c3
__b__and so i'm in the process of um - converting those alignments into uh - label files that we can use to train uh - a new net with .__c5
__s__and uh - so then i'll train the net .__c5
__b__and ==__c5
__s__an- - and one side effect of that would be that it's - um - that the phone set would change .__c3
__b__right .__c5
__s^2__so the m l p would be trained on i think only forty six or forty eight ==__c3
__b__eight .__c5
__s__forty eight phones .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__fg|qy__uh - which is smaller than the um - than the phone set that - that we've been using so far .__c3
__s^e__yeah .__c1
__fh__and that - that - that will probably help actually .__c3
__s__so it's a little different .__c5
__b__because um - the fewer dimensions uh - e- - the less trouble probably with the - as far as just the um - um ==__c3
__s__just ==__c3
__b__you know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features .__c3
__s__and so you h- - have to multiply everything by two or three .__c3
__s^aa__and so you know fewer dimensions in the phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view .__c3
__s^aa__sure .__c1
__fh__although we - i mean it's not that many fewer and - and - and we take a k l t anyway so we could ==__c1
__b__right .__c3
__s__exactly .__c3
__s__so - so that was the other thing .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c1
__s__and then we wanted to s- - just limit it to maybe uh - something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um - front end .__c3
__b__so that would mean just doing the top i don't know ten or twelve or something of the k l t dimensions .__c3
__s__yeah and i think - and we sh- - again check - we should check with stephane .__c1
__s__my impression was that when we did that before that had very little - uh - he didn't lose very much .__c1
__b__right .__c3
__s__by just taking the top whatever ?__c5
__b__yep .__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__yeah .__c1
__b__but then ==__c3
__qw^br^d^rt__and then something ==__c3
__s__once we have the new m l p trained up uh - one thing i wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh - like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know those features .__c3
__s^r__uh - and uh - | retrain m l p and also the you know the dictionary that we use for the hub five system .__c3
__s^bc__and the b- - and the base u- - starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i- - from a pretty decent system .__c1
__s^bc__exactly .__c3
__qy^br^d^rt__right .__c5
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^fa__so that would basically give us a um - more - hopefully a - a better system .__c3
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__um - | because - you know compared to what eric did a while ago where he trained up i think a system based on broadcast news .__c3
__fg|s.%-__and then uh - tra- - retraining it on switchboard .__c3
__s^na__or s- - uh - and ==__c3
__fg|s.%--__yeah .__c1
__qy^bh__but he - i think he d- - he didn't - he probably didn't use all the training data that was available .__c3
__s__and his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um - conversational speech as - as the - as ours is .__c3
__b__so ==__c3
__s__that's - that's certainly one thing yeah .__c1
__s__and the dictionary made a huge difference .__c3
__s__uh - yeah .__c1
__s__uh - | we - we made some improvements to the dictionary's uh - to the dictionary about two years ago .__c3
__b__which resulted in a uh - something like a four per cent absolute error rate reduction on switchboard .__c3
__fh|s__which ==__c3
__s__well the other thing is dipping deep into history and into uh - our resource management days when we were collaborating with s r i before .__c1
__qw__uhhuh .__c3
__s__huh .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__qy^d^f^g^rt__uh - | it was - i think it is was a really key uh - starting point for us that we actually got our alignment .__c1
__b__when we were working together we got our initial alignments from decipher uh - at the time .__c1
__qw__uhhuh .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__fh|s__uh - | and later we got away from it because - because once we had decent systems going then it was - it was typically better to use our own systems .__c1
__fh|qw__yeah .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__fg|s__because they were self- - consistent .__c1
__s__but - but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty per cent error uh - rate .__c1
__b__uh - | but that was a - that was a good - good - good way to start .__c1
__fg__yeah .__c3
__s^2__okay .__c3
__s^2__and we're not quite that bad with our - our switchboard systems but it was - they certainly aren't as good as s r i's .__c1
__%-__yeah .__c3
__s^2__so ==__c1
__%--__w- - what is the performance on s- - the best switchboard system that we've done ?__c5
__b__right .__c3
__s__roughly ?__c5
__b__well the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty per cent error .__c1
__s__and uh - it was ==__c1
__fh__i think there's just a whole lot of things that uh - no one ever had time for .__c1
__s__we never did really fix up the dictionary .__c1
__s^bk__uh - we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were going to do .__c1
__s^2__and - and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did .__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__fh|s.%--__huh .__c3
__s__but that w- ==__c3
__s^2|s^aa__uh - we never did an- - never did any adaptation .__c1
__b__even that - that number ==__c3
__fh|s.%-__right .__c3
__s__uh - | we never did any ==__c1
__s^nd__and - and that number i think was on switchboard one data .__c3
__fh__right ?__c3
__s^df^nd__where the error rate now is in the twenties .__c3
__s^df^nd__yeah .__c1
__fg|s^cs__so um ==__c3
__fh__yeah .__c1
__b__so we were ==__c1
__s__that's yet s- ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c1
__b__we were probably at least a factor or two off .__c1
__b__right .__c3
__b__yeah .__c1
__qy^d^f^g^rt__so it would be - so it would be good t- - to sort of r- - re- - uh ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do .__c3
__qw^cs__yeah .__c1
__s^na__but i think - again it's ==__c1
__s^e^rt__yeah .__c1
__b__it's the conver- - it's the s- - conversational speech bit .__c1
__s__because our - our broadcast news system is actually pretty good .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s__he knows .__c1
__b__right .__c3
__fh__and the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the m l p is trained up .__c3
__s^fa__right ?__c3
__s__because it's a pretty good um - indicator of that .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s^bk^t3__so it's sort of a sanity check of the m l p outputs before we go ahead and train up the - uh - you know use them as a basis for the tandem system .__c3
__qy^cs^t3__uhhuh .__c5
__s^co^t3__yeah .__c1
__qy^d^rt^t3__it'll still probably be worse .__c1
__s^cc^t3__i mean it's - it'd be context independent and so on .__c1
__s^ng^t3__no .__c3
__s^na^t3__sure .__c3
__s^bk__should we - should we bother with um - using the net before doing uh - embedded training ?__c5
__s__not ==__c3
__s^bsc__but ==__c3
__s__but ==__c1
__s__i mean should - should we even use that ?__c5
__s^bsc__oh oh that's a good question .__c3
__s__or should i just go straight to ?==__c5
__s^aap__yeah | we - we weren't sure whether it's worth to just use the alignments um - from the s r i recognizer .__c3
__s__or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign .__c3
__b__try it .__c0
__s__you run it .__c0
__b__keep - keep both versions .__c0
__b__see which one's better .__c0
__b__uh - | yeah .__c1
__s^2__i mean i think i agree with ad- ==__c1
__b__i mean basically you would then - you proceed with the embedded training .__c1
__qy^d^f^rt__uhhuh .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s__it's going to take you a while to train at this net anyway .__c1
__b__right .__c3
__b__and while it's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did .__c1
__s^cs^j__okay .__c3
__b__huh .__c5
__s^j__all right .__c3
__s^j__i could make arguments either way .__c0
__b__but - but so i ==__c3
__sj^ba__you know it's ==__c0
__s^cs^na__well but i- ==__c3
__s^rt__sort of given up guessing .__c0
__%--__but in your experience i mean - uh - have you seen big improvements in s- - on some tasks with embedded training ?__c3
__s^aa__or was it sort of smallish uh - improvements that you got ?__c3
__qw^j__uh - well - | it depended on the task .__c1
__s.%--__i mean i think in this one i would sort of expect it to be important .__c1
__s^cs__right .__c3
__s^fa^j__because we're coming from uh - alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system .__c1
__s__that are from another ==__c3
__b__right .__c3
__s__right .__c3
__b__although i mean we've done it with - when we were combining with the cambridge recurrent neural net embedded training made it worse .__c0
__s^e__uh ==__c1
__s__which i've never figured out .__c0
__b__right .__c1
__b__but i mean i- ==__c1
__s.%-__i think it's a bug .__c0
__b__so you - you started training with outputs from a - with alignments that were generated by the cambridge uh - system ?__c3
__sj^ba__yep .__c0
__s^rt__and then ==__c3
__s__uh - uh ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c1
__s^cs__well that might probably just ==__c3
__s__huh .__c3
__b__that was probably because your initial system - i mean your system was ba- - worse than cambridge's .__c3
__s^aa.%-__and you um ==__c3
__s^cs__was it ?__c1
__sj^ba^na__i don't think it was .__c1
__sj__no .__c0
__s__they were - they were comparable .__c0
__b__it wasn't ?__c3
__s^rt__no .__c1
__fg|s^cs__really ?__c3
__fg|s^rt__they were very close .__c0
__qy^bh^d^rt__yeah .__c1
__s^e__that's weird .__c3
__s^cs__excuse me ?__c1
__s__that's - that's weird .__c3
__b__no i mean it's weird that it did ==__c3
__s^cs__oh !__c1
__s^cs__that's what i said .__c0
__s^2__i'm sorry .__c3
__s^na__it's w- ==__c3
__fh__it's weird that it got worse .__c3
__s^cs^na__that's ambiguous .__c5
__s^cs^na__um - | no .__c1
__%__uh - | tha- - u- - we- - we've see- - i mean and wi- - with the numbers - o g i numbers task we've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better .__c1
__sj__oh actually it's not that weird .__c3
__s^cs__because we have seen ==__c3
__fh__we have seen cases where acoustic - retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better .__c3
__b__yeah .__c1
__s^cs__it just ==__c1
__s^j__yeah .__c3
__s__but i - but i would - i would suspect that something that - that had um - a very different um - feature set for instance .__c1
__s.%-__i mean they were using pretty diff- - similar feature sets to us .__c1
__qy^j__yep .__c0
__s^co^j__i - i would expect that something that had a different feature set would - would uh - benefit from .__c1
__fh__uhhuh .__c3
__fh|s^co^tc__what about uh - hidden unit size on this ?__c5
__fh|s^t__oh wait a minute .__c1
__s__and the other thing uh ==__c1
__s^e__oh .__c5
__fh|s__sorry .__c1
__fh|s__it was - the other thing is that what was in common to the cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors .__c1
__fh|s__right .__c0
__fh|s__so i mean uh - that's another pretty big difference .__c1
__s__uh - yeah .__c0
__s^df__that's another big difference .__c0
__fh|s__and uh - one bac- - at least ==__c1
__s^rt__back at ==__c1
__fh|s^rt__you mean with soft targets ?__c3
__fh|s__or ?==__c3
__s__sorry i'm sor- ==__c3
__qw^bu__i missed ==__c3
__s^br__what - what's the key issue here ?__c3
__s__oh that uh - both the cambridge system and our system were - were training posteriors .__c1
__s__and if we're - we're coming from alignments coming from the s r i system it's a likelihood based system .__c1
__fh|s__so - so that's another difference .__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^cs__i mean - you know there's diffe- - different front end different - different uh - um - training criterion .__c1
__b__uh - | i would think that in a- - that an embedded uh - embedded uh - training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__fh|s.%-__but we don't know .__c1
__s__okay .__c3
__s^bk^m.%-__you going to say something ?__c1
__s^co__yeah .__c5
__qy^bu^cc^d^rt__i was wondering uh - you know what size net i should ==__c5
__s^nd__anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?__c5
__b__uh - how much training data ?__c1
__s^na__well i was going to start off with the small train set .__c5
__s^aa__and how - how many hours is that ?__c1
__s^cc__that's why i was ==__c5
__b__i - i'm not sure how much that is .__c5
__b__uh - | i think that has about ==__c3
__s__well i- - you'd - would be gender dependent training .__c3
__s^cs__right ?__c3
__fh|s__gender dependent yeah .__c5
__fh|qy^co^rt^t^tc__so - so i think it's - uh - that's about huh something like thirty hours .__c3
__b__thirty hours ?__c5
__qy.%-__thirty hours per gender .__c3
__%-__i'm not sure what this'll mean .__c0
__s^ar__in the small training set ?__c5
__s__hello ?__c0
__fh|s^no__i - i think so .__c3
__qw__i'll ==__c3
__h|s__excuse me ?__c0
__qw^co__it's definitely less than a hundred .__c3
__s__you know it's more like - like thirty forty hours .__c3
__s__all right .__c0
__b__something like that .__c3
__s^bk__wrong number .__c0
__b__they called to tell us that ?__c5
__s__yeah .__c3
__%__yeah .__c1
__b__um - | so uh - after run ==__c1
__s__i mean i didn't want to do too big .__c5
__s.%--__right .__c1
__b__just ==__c5
__s__so ==__c1
__%--__at least a couple thousand hidden units .__c1
__fh__i mean ==__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^e__it's - it's th- - the thing i'll - i'll think about it a little more .__c1
__s^e__but it - it'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .__c1
__s__huh .__c5
__fh__you definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand .__c1
__s^no__it's m- - it's more than ==__c1
__b__and a thousand is too small ?__c5
__s__oh let me think about it .__c1
__s__but i think that - that uh - th- - at some point there's diminishing returns .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__b__i mean it doesn't actually get worse typically .__c1
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c0
__s^ar__but it - but - but there is diminishing returns .__c1
__s^nd__and you're doubling the amount of time .__c1
__b__remember you'll have a smaller output layer so there's going to be fewer parameters there .__c3
__s^bk__but not by a lot .__c0
__fh__not by much .__c1
__sj^ba__and then ==__c3
__s__fifty s- - fifty four to forty eight ?__c1
__sj^ba__vast majority is from the input unit .__c0
__s__okay .__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah .__c1
__%-__yeah .__c1
__fh__it'll have a very tiny effect .__c1
__s^na__right | because you used the context windows .__c0
__fg|s^bu__and so the input to hidden is much much larger .__c0
__b__yeah .__c1
__b__oh i see .__c3
__b__i see .__c3
__b__yeah of course .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__it's negligible | okay .__c3
__s.%-__yeah so it's - it'd be way way less than ten per cent of the difference .__c1
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c3
__b__uh - | there's uh ==__c1
__b__how bi- - how big ?==__c1
__s^aa__let's see .__c1
__b__what am i trying to think of ?__c1
__b__the - the net that - that we did use already uh - was eight thousand hidden units .__c5
__b__and that's the one that eric trained up .__c5
__s__right .__c1
__qy^rt__and that was trained up on uh - like a hundred and forty hours of - of speech .__c1
__s^aa__was that gender dependent or independent ?__c3
__sj^ba__gender dependent .__c5
__sj^ba__oh .__c1
__s__so that would be like trained on s- - sixty or seventy hours .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__sj^ba__so uh ==__c1
__sj^ba__yeah definitely not the one thousand uh - two thousand fr- ==__c1
__sj^ba^r__i mean the four thousand will be better .__c1
__s__and the two thousand will be almost - will be faster and almost as good .__c1
__s__it'll be faster .__c0
__s.%-__yeah .__c5
__b__so ==__c1
__s__maybe i'll start off with two thousand just to see .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^fa__okay .__c3
__s__okay .__c5
__b__yeah | thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh - seconds .__c1
__s__uh - | so that's like eleven - eleven million frames .__c1
__sj^ba__and a two thousand hidden unit net is uh - i guess about seven eight hundred thousand parameters .__c1
__s^j__so that's probably - that's probably fine .__c1
__b__i mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from .__c1
__b__but the two thousand would be faster .__c1
__s^j__so ==__c1
__s^co^rt^t^tc__right .__c3
__s^bk__i actually have to go .__c3
