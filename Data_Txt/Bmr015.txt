__z__all right .__c8
__z__so ==__c8
__z__so are you ?==__c4
__z__are we going ?__c4
__z__it is uh must be february fifteenth .__c8
__z__yeah .__cb
__z__yu- ==__c4
__z__i think the date's written in there yep .__c4
__z__and actually if everyone could cross out the r nine next to session and write m r eleven .__c4
__z__yeah .__c8
__z__yeah .__c8
__z__we didn't have a front end meeting today .__c8
__z__and let's remember also to make sure that one's gets marked as unread unused .__c4
__z__okay .__c8
__z__m r eleven ?__c1
__z__m r eleven .__c4
__z__that sounds like a spy code .__cb
__z__huh .__c8
__z__okay .__c8
__z__so ==__c8
__z__there's lots of clicking i'm sure as i'm trying to get this to work correctly .__c4
__z__agenda .__c8
__z__any agenda items today ?__c8
__z__i want to talk a little bit about getting - how we're going to to get people to edit bleeps parts of the meeting that they don't want to include .__c4
__z__what i've done so far and i want to get some opinions on how to - how to finish it up .__c4
__z__okay .__c8
__z__i want to ask about um some aud- - audio monitoring on some of the um well some of the equipment .__cb
__z__in particular the ==__cb
__z__well uh that's just what i want to ask .__cb
__z__okay audio monitoring jane .__c8
__z__ba- - based on some of the tran- - uh i- ==__cb
__z__in listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things .__cb
__z__and in pact - in fact this one i'm talking on is one of - of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings .__cb
__fg__so i ==__cb
__qy^t^tc__oh really ?__c4
__s__uhhuh .__cb
__s^na__yeah .__cb
__s__spikes you mean like uh instantaneous click type spikes or ?==__c2
__s^r__spikes ?__c1
__%-__clicks .__c4
__s__yeah .__cb
__s^df__huh .__c8
__qy^rt__yeah .__cb
__s^no__huh .__c2
__s^df__and i don't know what the e- - electronics is but ==__cb
__s^bk__yeah .__cb
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__s^e__well i think it's ==__c4
__s^bk|s__touching .__c1
__qy__uh | it - it could be a number of things .__c4
__s__it could be touching and fiddling .__c4
__h|s^na__yeah .__c1
__b__and the other thing is that it could ==__c4
__s^ba__the fact that it's on a wired mike is suspicious .__c4
__h__it might be a connector .__c4
__s.%--__oh okay .__cb
__%-__well maybe ==__cb
__s^bd__then we don't really have to talk about that as an ==__cb
__qy^bu^d__i - i take that off the agenda .__cb
__s^na__you could try an experiment and say okay i'm about to test for spikes .__c2
__s__and then wiggle the thing there .__c2
__s^df__and then go and when they go to transcribe it it could ask them to come and get you .__c2
__s^cs__yeah .__c4
__s^e__right .__c4
__s^bk__oh that ==__cb
__b__come get me when you transcribe this and see if there's spikes .__c2
__s^cs__um ==__c8
__%--__well okay .__cb
__s^ng__no i'm just ==__c2
__s^df__@reject@ .__c2
__b__i mean were this a professional audio recording what we would do - what you would do is - in testing it is you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that - that - that things are not giving that kind of performance .__c8
__s^cs.%--__and if they are then they can't be used .__c8
__s^bk__right .__c4
__s^cs__so ==__c8
__s^na__um | let's see .__c8
__b__i guess i would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh recording transcription .__c8
__s__you know basically you know where we are on the corpus .__c8
__s^t^tc__good .__cb
__s__and then um the other thing which i would like to talk about which is a real meta quest i think deal is uh agendas .__c8
__s__so maybe i'll - i'll start with that actually .__c8
__s__uh um | andreas brought up the fact that he would kind of like to know if possible what we were going to be talking about .__c8
__s__because he's sort of peripherally involved to this point .__c8
__qw__and if there's going to be a topic about - discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come .__c8
__s^cs__and - and i think part of - part of his motivation with this is that he's trying to help us out .__c8
__s^cs^e__in the - because of uh the fact that the meetings are - are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up .__c8
__s__and so he figures he could help that out by not showing .__c8
__b__and - and i'm sure help out his own time .__c8
__s__huh .__c4
__s^e__by not showing up if it's a meeting that he's - he's ==__c8
__s^cs.%--__so uh in order ==__c8
__s__i'd - i think that this is a wish on his part .__c8
__s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt__uh | it's actually going to be hard .__c8
__s^cs__because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated .__c8
__s__and - and ==__c8
__b__but um we could try anyway .__c8
__b__right .__c4
__s__uh - | do another try at coming up with the agenda uh at some point before the meeting .__c8
__s^df.%-__uh | say the day before .__c8
__s__well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on wednesday or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items .__c4
__s^bu__yeah .__c1
__b__okay .__c8
__s^aa|s^e__you - you want to volunteer to do that ?__c8
__s^bk^fe__sure .__c4
__s^bk__okay .__c8
__s^e__all right so we'll send out agenda request .__c8
__b__uh ==__c8
__fg|s__let me ==__c4
__fg__that'll be ==__c2
__s^bu__i think that'll help ==__c2
__s^aa__i'll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done .__c4
__s^aa__that'll help a lot actually .__c2
__s^bk__yeah i have to tell you for the uh for the admin meeting that we have lila does that um every time before an admin meeting .__c8
__s^rt__and uh she ends up getting the agenda requests uh uh ten minutes before the meeting .__c8
__s^df__but - but - but ==__c8
__s__uh but we can try .__c8
__s^df__maybe it'll work .__c8
__s^ba__yeah .__c4
__qw__huh .__c2
__s^rt__maybe .__c4
__s^bk|s^ba__yeah .__c8
__s^aa|s^na__weirder things have happened .__c4
__s^cs__i'm wondering if he were to just uh specify particular topics .__cb
__s^aa__i mean ==__cb
__s^bk__maybe we'd be able to meet that request of his a little more .__cb
__s^e__i would - i would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there'll be more things of interest to him .__c2
__fg|qy^bu^d^rt__well then ==__c4
__b__yeah .__c8
__s^bc__actually | it ==__c8
__s^bc__this - this maybe brings up another topic which is um ==__c8
__qh^bk__so we're done with that topic .__c8
__b__the other topic i was thinking of was the sta- - status on microphones and channels and all that .__c8
__%--__yeah actually i - i was going to say we need to talk about that too .__c4
__fg|s^cs__yeah .__c8
__s^aa__why - why don't we do that ?__c8
__s^bk__okay .__c4
__s^bk__um | the new microphones - the two new ones are in .__c4
__b__um | and they are being assembled as we speak i hope .__c4
__s^ba.%-__and i didn't bring my car today so i'm going to pick them up tomorrow .__c4
__b__um | and then the other question i was thinking about is - well a couple things .__c4
__qh__first of all if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable we should probably just go ahead and get them .__c4
__s^cs.%--__so we'll have to evaluate that when they come in .__c4
__b__and get people's opinions on - on what they think of them .__c4
__s^ba__uhhuh .__c1
__fg|qw__um | then the other question i had is maybe we should get another wireless .__c4
__s__another wireless setup .__c4
__s__i mean it's expensive but it does seem to be better than the wired .__c4
__qh^bk^d__so how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ?__c8
__s__um well | i'm pretty sure that you can daisy chain them together .__c4
__s__so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless .__c4
__s__so we currently have one base station with six wireless mike .__c4
__s^ba__possibility of six wireless receivers .__c4
__s^aa__and apparently you can chain those together .__c4
__b__and so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes .__c4
__s^ba__so um ==__c8
__b__and ==__c4
__b__so let's see we ==__c8
__s__so you know it's still it's fifteen minus six .__c4
__s^aa__right ?__c4
__s^bk|qy^bu^d__so we could have up to nine .__c4
__s^aa__and right now we can have up to six .__c8
__s^bk|s^ba__right .__c4
__s^df.%--__and we have five we're getting one more .__c4
__s__yeah .__c8
__s^ar|s^na__and it's um about nine hundred dollars for the base station .__c4
__s__and then eight hundred per channel .__c4
__s^df__oh .__c8
__b__so yeah so the only ==__c8
__b__beyond the mike - the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that's nine hundred dollars .__c8
__s^co__right .__c4
__s.%__oh we should do it .__c8
__s__okay .__c4
__s__yeah .__c8
__s^bk__okay so i'll look into how you daisy chain them and - and then just go ahead and order them .__c4
__s^bu__yeah .__c8
__h|s^aa^rt__i don't quite understand how that - how that works .__c2
__s^cs__if ==__c2
__s__so we're not increasing the number of channels .__c2
__s^cs__no | we're just replacing the wired - the two wired that are still working .__c4
__s^bk.%__okay .__c2
__s^cs__okay .__c2
__b__i see .__c2
__s^bu__along with a couple of the wired that aren't working - one of the wired that's not working with a wireless .__c4
__b__yeah .__c8
__qy^d^f^g__basically we found ==__c8
__b__three wireds work .__c2
__s^aa__right ?__c2
__b__i - i guess three wireds work yeah .__c4
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^df.%--__yeah .__c8
__s__but we've had more problems with that .__c8
__s^aa__yep .__c4
__s__and that sort of bypasses the whole - the whole jimbox thing and all that .__c8
__s^df^e__right .__c4
__s__and so um we - we seem to have uh a reliable way of getting the data in which is through the ra- - sony radio mikes .__c8
__s^df__as long as we're conscious about the batteries .__c8
__s^aa__that seems to be the key issue .__c8
__s__right .__c4
__b__everyone's battery okay ?__c4
__s^bk^fe__i checked them this morning .__c2
__b__they should be .__c2
__b__okay .__c4
__b__yeah .__c8
__s.%--__um | because that's the only thing with them .__c8
__s.%--__but the quality seems really good .__c8
__s__and ==__c8
__b__um | i heard from u w that they're - they're uh very close to getting their uh setup purchased .__c8
__s__they're - they're - they're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf .__c8
__b__well we should talk to them about it because i know that s r i is also in the process of looking at stuff .__c4
__s__and so you know what we should try to keep everyone - on the same page with that .__c4
__s^na|s^ba__yeah .__c8
__s__s r i ?__c2
__s__really ?__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__s__oh .__c2
__s__they got sa- - apparent- ==__c4
__b__well maybe this needs to be bleeped out ?__c4
__s^bd__i have no clue .__c4
__fh__uh | i don't know .__c8
__s^na__i don't know how much of it's public .__c4
__%-__probably we shouldn't - probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff .__c8
__s^aa__right .__c4
__s^df__yeah .__c8
__%-__but anyway there's - there's - there's uh uh other activities that are going on there and - and uh and nist and u w .__c8
__s^aa__so ==__c8
__s__um | but - but yeah i thin- - i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is - is quite positive with the sony .__c8
__fg|s__uh radio mikes .__c8
__fh__right .__c4
__s^cs__now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you're talking about changing the headsets .__c8
__s^bk__meaning changing the connector which means some hand soldering or something .__c8
__b__right ?__c8
__b__uh | no .__c4
__s^bk|s__no ?__c8
__s__we're having the - them do it .__c4
__s^2__so it's so- - hand soldering it but i'm not doing it .__c4
__b__oh .__c8
__s^bd__okay .__c8
__fh__so they - they charge .__c4
__s^bk__nothing against you and your hand soldering .__c8
__fg|s^t^tc__right ?__c4
__s.%--__but ==__c8
__s__you've never seen my hand soldering .__c4
__s__but uh a- - as i said they're coming in .__c4
__s__uh | okay so that's being done professionally ==__c8
__s__and ==__c8
__s^2__yeah .__c8
__s^aa__i - i mean ==__c4
__s.%-__yeah .__c4
__%-__i mean ==__c4
__b__yeah .__c8
__s__as professionally as i guess you can get it done .__c4
__s__well it could ==__c8
__s^bk__if they do a lot of it it's ==__c8
__s__i mean i- - it's just their repair shop .__c4
__b.%__right ?__c4
__s^bk__their maintenance people .__c4
__s^no__well we'll see what it - it's like .__c8
__s^cs__yep .__c4
__s^ar|s^df__that - tha- - that can be quite good .__c8
__%-__th- - this ==__c8
__s^bk|s^ba__yeah okay .__c8
__%--__good .__c8
__b__yeah .__c8
__s__so let's go with that .__c8
__s^aa__uh ==__c8
__s__and i mean we'll see tomorrow you know what it looks like .__c4
__s__yeah .__c8
__s:s__so um uh dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits .__c8
__s__uh | so he'll be interested in what's going on with that .__c8
__s__i guess ==__c8
__fh__was - the decision last time was that the - the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ?__c8
__b__uhhuh .__cb
__s__has that started or is that ?==__c8
__s^bk__yeah .__cb
__fg|s^tc__uh it would be to use his interface and i was going to meet with him today about that .__cb
__s^bu__right | so | the decision was that jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork .__c4
__s^aa__so i did the - all that last week .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__so all the - all the forms are now on the computer .__c4
__s^bu__and uh then i have a bunch of scripts that we'll read those and let the uh transcribers use different tools .__c4
__s^aa__and i just want to talk to jane about how we transition to using those .__c4
__s^bk__uhhuh .__cb
__fh__so he has a nice set up that they ==__cb
__s__it w- - it will be efficient for them to do that .__cb
__s^e__okay .__c8
__s^bd__so anyway ==__c8
__s__i - i don't think it'll take too long .__c4
__fh__so you know just uh a matter of a few days i suspect .__c4
__s__so anyway i think we - we have at least one uh user for the digits once they get done which will be dave .__c8
__s__right .__c4
__s__i've already done five or six sets .__c4
__%--__okay .__cb
__s.%--__so if he wanted to you know just have a few to start with he could .__c4
__s__yeah he might - he might be asking ==__c8
__fh__you know and i also have a bunch of scripts that will like generate p files and run recognition on them also .__c4
__s^ba__right .__c8
__s__okay .__c8
__s__uh | is dave ?==__c8
__s__i don't know if dave is on the list .__c8
__s__if he's invited to these meetings ==__c8
__fh__uh ==__c8
__s__i don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even .__cb
__fh__if he knows ==__c8
__s__no no .__c1
__fh__uh | we don't have a active one .__c4
__qw^rt__but i'll make sure he's on the list .__c4
__s__yeah .__cb
__s__should we call him ?__cb
__%-__i mean is he d- - is he definitely not available today ?__cb
__s^bk__i don't know .__c8
__fh__should i call his office and see ?__cb
__s^rt__uh well | i- - it's uh ==__c8
__%-__he was in .__c1
__s__i mean he's still taking classes so uh he may well have conflicts .__c4
__qy.%-__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__c8
__s__yeah | he was in s- ==__c1
__s__he wasn't there at cof- ==__cb
__b__yeah so this might be a conflict for him .__c8
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__okay .__cb
__s^ba__yeah .__c8
__s^df__okay .__c8
__s.%-__uh | so ==__c8
__s^ba^fe__yeah didn't he say his signal processing class was like tuesdays and thursdays ?__c4
__s^na__i think he has a class .__c1
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__he might have .__c2
__b__oh okay .__c8
__s__you talking about david gelbart ?__c5
__s__oh well whatever .__c4
__b__yeah .__c8
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__yes .__cb
__b__yeah .__c1
__b__yeah i think he's taking two twenty five a which is now .__c5
__b__yeah .__c8
__s__okay .__cb
__s__so ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^am__okay .__c8
__%-__so that's why we're not seeing him .__c8
__s^bu^rt__okay .__c8
__qy^g^rt__uh | transcriptions uh beyond the digits where we are and so on .__c8
__s^e^rt__okay .__cb
__qy^rt__and the - and the recordings also .__c8
__s^ar__um ==__cb
__s__just where we are .__c8
__%-__yeah .__c8
__b__well | so um - should we - we don't wan- - want to do the recording status first or ?==__cb
__s__well | we have about thirty two hours .__c4
__%--__uh - | as of i guess a week and a half ago .__c4
__s__so we probably now have about thirty five hours .__c4
__%-__and - and that's - that's uh ==__c8
__%-__how much of that is digits ?__c8
__b.%__it's uh ==__c8
__s__that's including digits .__c8
__s__that's including digits .__c4
__b__right ?__c8
__b__so ==__c8
__s__i haven't separated it out so i have no clue how much of that is digits .__c4
__s^2.%--__yeah .__c8
__s__so anyway there's at least probably thirty hours .__c8
__b__or something of ==__c8
__b__there's got to be more than thirty hour ==__c8
__s__i- - it couldn't ==__c8
__s__of - of non digits ?__c4
__b__of - of non digits .__c8
__fh__huh .__c1
__b__yeah absolutely .__c4
__b__yeah yeah .__c8
__s__i mean the digits don't take up that much time .__c4
__s^aa__okay .__c8
__b__okay | and the transcribers h- ==__cb
__s__i uh don't have the exact numbers .__cb
__s.%--__but i think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh transcribing from them right now .__cb
__%--__the next step is to - that i'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first and then channelized .__cb
__s__what i mean by clean is that they're spell checked .__cb
__b__that the mark up is consistent all the way throughout .__cb
__s^e__and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh liz requested in terms of um um in terms of having a s- - a systematic handling of numbers and acronyms which i hadn't been specific about .__cb
__s.%-__um | for example i- - they'll say uh ninety two .__cb
__qw^rt__and you know so how - you could ==__cb
__qy^e^rt__nine two .__c4
__s__e- - exactly .__cb
__s__right .__c4
__s.%--__so if you just say nine two the - there are many s- - ways that could have been expressed .__cb
__fh__an- - and i just had them ==__cb
__s__i - i mean a certain number of them did put the words down .__cb
__s__but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by um a gloss th- - and things .__cb
__fh__you know jane ?__c2
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c4
__fh__um one suggestion ==__c2
__s^no__and you may already be doing this .__c2
__s.%--__but i've noticed in the past that when i've gone through transcriptions - and you know in - in order to build lexicons and things ==__c2
__fh__if you um just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them a lot of times just scanning down that list you'll find a lot of inconsistencies and mis- ==__c2
__s__misspelled .__c4
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__b__you're talking about the type token frequency listings and i use those too .__cb
__s^e__y- - you mean just uh on each - on each line there's a one word .__cb
__s.%--__right ?__cb
__fh__it's one token from the - from the corpus .__cb
__s^no__uhhuh .__c2
__fh__uhhuh .__c2
__s^no__yeah those are e- - extremely efficient .__cb
__s.%--__and i- - and i - i agree that's a very good use of it .__cb
__s^bd__oh | so you already have that .__c2
__s__okay .__c2
__qy__well that's - that's a way - that's ==__cb
__s^e__you know the spell check basically does that .__cb
__s^no__but - but in addition ==__cb
__s^bk__yes that's - that's exactly the strategy i want to do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__exactly .__cb
__qy__because a lot of times they'll appear next to each other and uh ==__c2
__%--__and then you ca- - then you can do a s- ==__cb
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__s^no__i- - in alphabetized lists they'll appear next to each other and - and so it makes it easier .__c2
__%--__absolutely .__cb
__b__i agree .__cb
__s^ba__that's a very good - that's a very good uh suggestion .__cb
__%-__and that was - that's my strategy for handling a lot of these things in terms of things that need to be glossed .__cb
__s^df__i didn't get to that point .__cb
__b__but ==__cb
__s__so there are numbers then there are acronyms .__cb
__s__and then um there's a - he- - she wants the uh actually a - an explicit marker of what type of comment this is .__cb
__b__so i- - curly b- - inside the curly brackets i'm going to put either voc for vocalized .__cb
__s__like cough or like laugh or whatever .__cb
__s__nonvoc for door slam .__cb
__qo__and gloss for things that have to do with - if they said a s- - a spoken form with this m- - this pronunciation error .__cb
__qw^e__right .__c4
__fh__i already had that convention .__cb
__s__but i - i haven't been asking these people to do it systematically .__cb
__qw__oh that's great .__c2
__%-__because i think it most - ha- - most efficiently handled by uh by a - a filter .__cb
__fh__that was what i was always planing on .__cb
__s^j__so that you know you get a whole long list ==__cb
__s^ba^fe__exactly what you're saying .__cb
__fh__you get a whole list of things that say curly bracket laugh curly bracket .__cb
__s.%-__uhhuh .__c2
__%-__then y- - you know it's - it's ==__cb
__s^bu__you - you risk less error if you handle it by a filter than if you have this transcriber ch- - laboriously typing in sort of a voc space ==__cb
__s^bu^rt__yeah .__c2
__s^aap__so man- - so many ways that error prone .__cb
__qy^d^f^g__right .__c2
__s^bk__right .__c2
__s^df.%-__so um um i'm - i'm going to convert that via a filter into these tagged uh subcategorized comments .__cb
__fg|s__and same thing with you know we see you get a subset when you do what you're saying .__cb
__s^aa__you end up with a s- - with uh you're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens .__cb
__fg|s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__and you can um have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__fh__but the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand .__cb
__s__because you know i mean jus- ==__cb
__b__you don't know what they could be .__c4
__s^e__yeah | now timit's clear um - and p l p is clear .__cb
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^e__but uh there are things that are not so well known in ==__cb
__fh__or - or have variant u- - u- - uses like the numbers you can say nine two or you can say ninety two .__cb
__s__and uh ==__cb
__s__so how are you doing the ?==__c4
__s__i'd handle the numbers individually .__cb
__qo^rt__how are you doing the uh acronyms so if i say p z m what would it appear on the transcript ?__c4
__s^j__it would be separate .__cb
__fh__the letters would be separated in space .__cb
__s^aa|s.x__okay .__c4
__s^e__and potentially they'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards .__cb
__fh__e- ==__cb
__s__but i'm not sure if that's necessary clarifying what it is .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__so gloss of whatever .__cb
__b__right .__c4
__fh__i don't know if that's really necessary to do that .__cb
__b__maybe it's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh a step away from i- - indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there .__cb
__s__and indicating why they're there to indicate that it's uh the you know uh - enumerated or i- ==__cb
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__b__it's not a good way of saying .__cb
__b.x__but it's - it's the specific uh way of stating these - these letters .__cb
__s__right .__c4
__s__so it sounds good .__c4
__qy^rt__and so anyway the clean - those are those things .__cb
__h|s^no__and then channelized is to then um get it into this multichannel format .__cb
__s^e__and at that point then it's ready for use by liz and don .__cb
__s^r__but that's been my top priority - beyond getting it tanel- - channelized .__cb
__s.%--__the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins .__cb
__s^rt__yeah .__c1
__%--__right .__c4
__fh__and uh thilo had a e- - e- - a breakthrough with this - this last week in terms of getting the channel based um uh s- - s- - speech-nonspeech segmentation um up and running .__cb
__s__and i haven't - i haven't been able to use that yet .__cb
__b__because i'm working ==__cb
__s^bd__s- - re- ==__cb
__fh__this is my top priority - get the data clean and channelized .__cb
__s.%--__i actually gave ==__c1
__b__have you also been doing spot checks jane ?__c4
__s.%--__oh yes .__cb
__%--__okay good .__c4
__s^rt__well you see that's part of the cleaning process .__cb
__b__i spent um ==__cb
__b__actually um i have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers .__cb
__fg|s__oh good .__c4
__s__good .__c4
__s__and i went through it last night it's - it's almost spooky how similar these are word for word .__cb
__s__and there are some differences in commas because commas i - i left them discretion at commas .__cb
__qy^bu^d^rt^t^tc__right .__c4
__s^aa__uh - | and so ==__cb
__s__because it's not part of our st- - of our ne- - needed conventions .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__s__and um ==__cb
__s__and - so they'll be a difference in commas .__cb
__s^df__but it's word by word the same in - in huge patches of the data .__cb
__b__and i have t- - ten minute stretch where i can - where i can show that .__cb
__fh__and - and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon .__cb
__s^e__and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech .__cb
__s^df__so um the one i- - i- - the colloquial speech person picked up gobbledy gook .__cb
__s^ba__huh .__c2
__s__and the other one didn't .__cb
__s__and on this side this one's picking up things like neural nets and the one that's good on the sp- - o- - on th- - the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't .__cb
__s__right .__c4
__s__when ==__c2
__s.%--__for the person who missed gobbledy gook what did they put ?__c2
__s^df.%--__it was an interesting approximation put in parentheses .__cb
__s__because i have this convention that i- - if they're not sure what it was they put it in parentheses .__cb
__s.%-__oh .__c2
__s__so they tried to approximate it but it was ==__cb
__s^bk__oh good .__c2
__s^f__it was spelled g a b b l ==__cb
__s^df^e__sort of how it sounds ?__c2
__s__yes .__cb
__fh__more of an attempt to ==__cb
__s^bk|s^ba.%-__yeah .__c2
__s__i mean apparently it was very clear to her that these - the- - a- - this - this was a sound - these are the sounds .__cb
__%-__it was a technical term that she didn't recognize .__c4
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__but ==__cb
__s^bk__yeah .__cb
__s^ba__but she knew that she didn't know it .__cb
__s^rt__maybe it was a technical ter- ==__cb
__qy^bu^d^rt__exactly .__cb
__s^aa__but she even - though her technical perception is just really - uh you ==__cb
__s^ba__know i've - i'm tempted to ask her if she's taken any courses in this area or if she's taken cognitive science courses .__cb
__qy^bu^d^rt__right .__c4
__s^cs.%--__then because neural nets and - oh she has some things that are - oh down sampled she got that right .__cb
__s^cs^e__huh .__c2
__s^cs^e__and some of these are rather uh unexpected .__cb
__s^cs^e__obscure .__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^ng__but ch- - ten solid uh m- - ch- - s- - chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data .__cb
__s__and um ==__cb
__s^bk__and - and again the main track that you're working with is elev- - eleven hours ?__c8
__s__is that right ?__c8
__s__yes exactly .__cb
__fg|s__yeah okay .__c8
__s__and that's part of this ==__cb
__s__eleven hours .__cb
__s^ba__is that - is that - that including digits ?__c8
__s^bk__yes it is .__cb
__s__yeah .__c8
__s__so let's say roughly ten hours or so of ==__c8
__s__uhhuh .__cb
__fh__i mean it's probably more than that but - but with - of - of non digits .__c8
__s^cs__it'd be more than that .__cb
__s__yeah .__c1
__fh__because i - my recollection is the minutes - that da- - digits don't take more than half a minute per person .__cb
__s__oh okay .__c8
__s__but um the - the total set that i gave them is twelve hours of tape .__cb
__s^df^no__oh i see .__c8
__s__but they haven't gotten to the end of that yet .__cb
__b__so they're still working - some of them are - two of them are still working on completing that .__cb
__b__oh i see .__c8
__s__yeah .__cb
__s__boy they're moving right along .__c2
__b__yeah | they are .__cb
__fh__yeah .__c8
__b__uhhuh | they're very efficient .__cb
__s^ba__there're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__fh__uhhuh .__c2
__s__yeah .__cb
__s__so what - what - what's the deal with - with your ?==__c8
__s__the channel u- - thing ?__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c8
__s^bk__oh it's just uh i ran the recognizer - uh the speech-nonspeech detector on different channels .__c1
__s.%-__and it's just in uh - in this new multi channel format and output .__c1
__s^ba__and i just gave one - one meeting to - to liz who wanted to - to try it for - for the recognizer .__c1
__b__oh i see .__c8
__fh|qw^t^tc__as uh apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech which took too much memory or whatever .__c1
__b__right .__c8
__s.%--__yeah .__c8
__%--__and so she - she will try that i think .__c1
__s.%--__and ==__c1
__s__i'm - i'm working on it .__c1
__s__so i hope ==__c1
__s__is this anything different than the h m m system you were using before ?__c4
__s__yeah .__c8
__%--__no .__c1
__s__uh | i huh use some - some different features but not - not ==__c1
__fh__uhhuh .__c4
__s__the basic thing is this h m m base .__c1
__s^cs__so there's still no - no knowledge using different channels at the same time .__c4
__s^cs__you know what i mean ?__c4
__s^cs__there is some uh as the energy is normalized across channels .__c1
__s^cs__across all of them .__c4
__s^cs__yeah .__c1
__s__okay .__c4
__s__so ==__c1
__s^am^ba__but basically that's one of the main changes .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c8
__s__what are some of the other features besides the energy ?__c8
__s__you said you're trying some different features or something .__c8
__s^bk__oh i just uh - huh - i just use um - our loudness based things .__c1
__s^ng__now as they ==__c1
__s__before there were - they were some in - in the log domain and i - i changed this to the - to the ==__c1
__b__cu- - cube root .__c8
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__to ==__c1
__b__no | i changed this to the - to the - to the loudness thingy with the - with the ==__c1
__s.%--__huh .__c4
__s__uh .__c8
__b__how do you call it ?__c1
__s__i'm not sure .__c1
__b__with the uh ==__c1
__s^ba__fletcher munson ?__c8
__s.%--__no .__c8
__fh__i'm not sure about the term .__c1
__s^no__oh okay .__c8
__s__uh i'll look it up .__c1
__fh__yeah all right .__c8
__s^ba__and say it to you .__c1
__s__uh okay and ==__c1
__fh__yeah .__c1
__s__that's - that's basically the - the - the thing .__c1
__b__okay .__c8
__s__yeah | and i - and i tried t- - to normalize uh uh the features there's loudness and modified loudness um - within one channel .__c1
__s__because they're - yeah to - to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech .__c1
__fh__and it works quite well .__c1
__s__but not always .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__b__uhhuh .__c8
__s^df.%--__so ==__c1
__b__okay .__c8
__s__good .__c4
__s.%--__um let's see .__c8
__s__i think the uh ==__c8
__s^e.%--__were - were you basically done with uh transcriptions or ?==__c8
__s__so i guess the next thing is this uh bleep editing .__c8
__s^ba^bd__right .__c4
__s^df__so the - the idea is that we need to have ==__c4
__s.%--__we need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want .__c4
__s__so i've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece - pieces and they can scroll through and read them .__c4
__s^df__and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded .__c4
__s^bk|s^ba^ng__and then it's a form - h t m l form so they can submit it and it will end up sending me e mail with the times that they want excluded .__c4
__s__and so uh some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue .__c4
__s^e^rt__yeah .__c8
__s__and so i thought about this a little bit and i think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password .__c4
__fh__a single password .__c4
__s^bk__each person will have a single password user name and password .__c4
__s^cs__and then each meeting we'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it .__c4
__s__and that way each person only has to remember one password .__c4
__b__i - i can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed .__c8
__s__i mean if people have ==__c8
__b__uh ==__c8
__s^df.%--__i mean for me i would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and i would sort of flip through it .__c8
__s^ba__and then um if i thought it was okay i'd say it's okay .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__and i ==__c8
__b__uh - | i mean it depends how this really ends up working out .__c8
__s^e__but i guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was okay or not and needing to listen to it was going to be extremely rare .__c8
__s^ba__right | i mean so th- - th- - th- - the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that i had already done for other reasons .__c4
__fh|s__okay .__c8
__s^ba__and so that - that's a minor part of it .__c4
__s__i just wanted some web interface so that people - you didn't actually have to send everyone the text .__c4
__s__so m- - what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready um i would take them and generate the web pages .__c4
__s^ba__and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted .__c4
__s^df__and just uh - tell them here's the web page .__c4
__s^ba^r__um  you need a password .__c4
__fg|s^ba^t^tc__so th- - th- - question number one is how do we distribute the passwords ?__c4
__s__and question number two is how else do we want to provide this information if they want it ?__c4
__s^aa__that's ==__c8
__b__i think what i was sort of saying is that if you just say here is a - here is ==__c8
__s__i mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but - but i just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper that said uh here's what was said in this transcription is it okay with you .__c8
__fh__and if it is here's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it's okay .__c8
__%--__i think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide .__c4
__b__and then they'd hand it back to you .__c8
__s__but certainly i wouldn't want a printout .__c4
__b__these are big .__c4
__s__and i would much rather be ha- - be able to just sit and leaf through it .__c4
__b__you find it easier to go through a large ?==__c8
__s__i mean how do you read books ?__c8
__s.%--__well i certainly read books by hand .__c4
__fh__but for something like this i think it's easier to do it on the web .__c4
__s__really ?__c8
__b__i mean it ==__c8
__s__because you're going to get you know if i - i'm - i'm in a bunch of meetings and i don't want to get a stack of these .__c4
__fh__i want to just be able to go to - go to the web site and visit it as i want .__c4
__s__going to a web site is easy .__c8
__fh__but flipping through a hundred pounds - a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web .__c8
__s__well i don't think it's that much harder than paper .__c4
__s^df^rt__i have one question .__cb
__s.%--__really ?__c8
__fh__so ==__c4
__s__so are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript ?__cb
__s^df__because i - i do think that there's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the ==__cb
__b__so here's the way i was imagining it and maybe i'm wrong .__c8
__s^no__yeah .__cb
__s^bsc__but the way i imagined it was that um the largest set of people is going to go oh yeah i didn't say anything funny in that meeting .__c8
__fh__just go ahead .__c8
__b__where's the - where's the release ?__c8
__s__and then there'll be a subset of people .__c8
__fg|s__right ?__c8
__s.%--__okay there's ==__c8
__s^cs__i mean think of who it is we've been recording mostly .__c8
__s^bk__okay there'll be a subset of people who um will say uh well yeah i really would like to see that .__c8
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^bk|s^2__and for them the easiest way to flip through if it's a really large document ==__c8
__b__i mean unless you're searching .__c8
__fh__searching of course should be electronic .__c8
__%-__but if you're not ==__c8
__s.%-__so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that .__c8
__s^df__yeah .__c1
__s.%-__but see then we're getting more elaborate with this thing .__c8
__s^bk__um | if - if uh - you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really really long document .__c8
__fh__i mean whenever i've had a really really long document that it was sitting on the web i've always ended up printing it out .__c8
__qy__i mean so it's - it's ==__c8
__s^ar|%-__i mean you - you're - you're not necessarily going to be sitting at the desk all the time .__c8
__s^ar__you want to figure you have a train ride and there's all these situations where - where i ==__c8
__s^e__i mean this is how i was imagining it anyway .__c8
__s^ar__and then i figured that out of that group there would be a subset who would go huh you know i'm really not sure about this section here .__c8
__fg|%-__and then that group would need it ==__c8
__s^ar|s__s- - it seems like i- ==__c8
__s__if i'm right in that it seems like you're setting it up for the most infrequent case rather than for the most frequent case .__c8
__b__so that uh now we have to worry about privacy .__c8
__fh__well no fre- - for the most ==__c4
__s.%--__we have to worry about all these passwords for different people .__c8
__fh__for the most frequent case they just say it's okay .__c4
__s^rt__and then they're done .__c4
__s.%--__and i think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c8
__s__the other thing too is it seems like ==__cb
__s^bsc__um | yeah that's true .__c8
__fh|s.%--__go ahead .__cb
__b__i mean because you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to .__c4
__s^cs__yeah .__c1
__s__i guess ==__c8
__fg|s__yeah i guess we don't need their signature .__c8
__%-__i guess an email okay is all right .__c8
__s^df__oh that was another thing .__c4
__s^no__i - i had assumed that we didn't need their signature that it - that an email approval was sufficient .__c4
__s^cs__but i don't actually know .__c4
__b__are - are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking ?__c2
__s.%--__yes .__c4
__s^e__i also ==__cb
__fh__if someone feels strongly enough about it then i - i - i think they should be allowed to do that .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__cb
__s^cs__so that means other people are editing what you say ?__c2
__fh__uh i don't know about that .__c8
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__s^cs__i don't know if i like that .__c2
__s.%--__well the only other choice is that the person would say no don't distribute this meeting at all .__c4
__fh__and i would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say don't distribute it at all .__c4
__s^cs__but th- - what they signed in the consent form was something that said you can use my voice .__c8
__s^cs.%--__well but if - if someone is having a conversation and you only bleep out one side of it that's not sufficient .__c4
__s^cs__right ?__c8
__s^cs.%--__yeah .__c8
__b__yeah | but that's our decision then .__c8
__s^bu__right ?__c8
__%-__um | i don't think so .__c4
__s^na|s^aa__i think it is .__c8
__b__i mean because if i object to the conversation ==__c4
__qy^bu^rt__if i say we were having a conversation and i consider that conversation private and i consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer i want to be able to bleep out your side .__c4
__s^nd__the ==__cb
__qrr.%-__i agree that the consent forms were uh i cons- ==__cb
__s^df__i agree with what adam's saying that um the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe- - whether they said them or didn't say them .__cb
__qy^br^m^rt__i see .__c8
__s^na|s^aa__okay well if that's what it said .__c8
__s^nd^r__and the other thing is from the standpoint of the l- - of the l- ==__cb
__s^m^na|s^aa__i'm not a law- - lawyer .__cb
__s^m^na|s^aap__but it strikes me that uh we wouldn't want someone to say oh yes i was a little concerned about it .__cb
__s^df|s^ar__but it was too hard to access .__cb
__%-__so i think it's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it .__cb
__s.%--__now in terms of like editing it by hand i mean i think it's - i- - some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited .__cb
__fh__but - but it seems to me that sometimes um you know i- - if a person had a bad day and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like you know it's nice - it's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was okay .__cb
__s^no__i mean i can certainly provide a printable version if people want it .__c4
__fh__um | i mean it's also a mixture of people .__c8
__s^bu__um ==__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__i mean some people are r- - do their work primarily by sitting at the computer flipping around the web .__c8
__s^e__and others do not .__c8
__s^aa__yep .__c4
__b__others would consider it ==__c8
__qy.%-__this uh a - a set of skills that they would have to gain .__c8
__s.%--__you know ?__c8
__s.%--__well i think most of the people in the meetings are the former .__c4
__fh__it depends on what meetings .__c8
__s^bu__that's true .__cb
__qy^d^g^rt__so far .__c2
__b__so ==__c4
__s^e__in the meetings so far yeah .__c8
__s^aa__yep .__c4
__h__but we're trying to expand this .__c8
__s^aa|s^ba__right ?__c8
__b__right .__c4
__s^arp^df__so i - i - i actually think that paper is the more universal thing .__c8
__s^co^fe^j__and that ==__c4
__s^ng__uhhuh .__cb
__s^ba^bd__well but if they want to print it out that's all right .__c4
__s^no__yeah .__cb
__s.%--__i think everyone in the meeting can access the web .__c4
__b__no i think we have to be able to print it out .__c8
__qw^t1__it's not just if they want to print it out .__c8
__s__okay | so does that mean that i can't use email ?__c4
__s__i - i think ==__c8
__s^fa^t3__or what ?__c4
__s.%--__because you could send it through email you're thinking .__cb
__fh__i - i th- ==__c8
__s^aa|s^am.%--__well we ==__c8
__s__well i don't think i ==__c4
__s.%--__there was this ==__c8
__b__well i don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues .__c4
__s^cs__good .__cb
__s^df__no .__c8
__b__for security ?__cb
__s.%--__yeah okay good .__cb
__fh__yeah .__c1
__s__right .__c8
__s__good point .__cb
__s__um | so giving them you think a web site to say if you want to print it out here it is is not sufficient ?__c4
__qh__@reject@ .__cb
__%-__yeah .__c1
__s^cc__i ==__c1
__s^e.%--__certainly for everybody who's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient .__c8
__s^e.%--__i'm just wondering about ==__c8
__s^df__yeah | i'm just thinking for people that that's not sufficient for what - the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them .__c4
__fh__you could mail it to them .__cb
__s__get an- - a - mailing address .__cb
__s^df__yeah .__c1
__s__equivalent .__c4
__fh__but i think it's easier to drop in the box .__cb
__b__but ==__c1
__s__just put the button on - on the web page which say please send me the - the scripts .__c1
__s^bd__oh that's interesting .__cb
__s.%--__that's right .__c4
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^bd^df__what um ?==__c2
__s^cs__when you display it on the web page what are - what are you showing them ?__c2
__b__utterances ?__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s__or ?==__c2
__s.%--__and so can they bleep within an utterance ?__c2
__s^cs__no .__c4
__s.%--__whole utterances only .__c4
__b__whole utterances .__c2
__fh__and that was just convenience for my sake that it's uh - uh ==__c4
__s__it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub utterance level .__c4
__s^2__because this way i can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand .__c4
__s^bk__there's another aspect to this which maybe is part of why this is bothering me .__c8
__s__um | i think you're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this .__c8
__s__i mean that's why i did the web form because for me that would be my most convenient .__c4
__s__huh .__c2
__b__i - i - i understand .__c8
__s.%--__i think that's the bad idea .__c8
__s^co__i know where you're going .__c2
__fh__oh .__c4
__s^bu__see because you're gon- - you're - uh ==__c8
__fh__really !__c8
__%--__you're going to end up with all these little patchy things whereas really what we want to do is have the - the - the bias towards letting it go .__c8
__qw__because nob- - you ==__c8
__qy^bu^d^rt__know it ==__c8
__qrr.%--__there was a ==__c8
__s^ar__one or twi- - once or twice in the re- - in the meetings we've heard where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by .__c8
__s.%-__but overall people are talking about technical topics .__c8
__%-__nobody's going to get hurt .__c8
__s__nobody's being l- - libeled .__c8
__%-__you know this is - this - we're - we're covering ==__c8
__s^bu__we're playing the lawyer's game and we're playing - we're - we're - we're looking for the extreme case .__c8
__z__if we really orient it towards that extreme case make it really easy we're going to end up encouraging a headache .__c8
__z__that - i think that's ==__c8
__z__i'm sort of psyching myself out here .__c8
__z__i - i'm trying to uh ==__c8
__z__but i - i think that's ==__c8
__z__i guess i don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that mu- - much of a headache bleeped out .__c4
__b__well it's ==__c8
__b__so ==__c4
__z__but i- ==__c8
__z__i think what morgan's saying is the easier it is the more is going to be bleeped .__c2
__z__and - and it really depends on what kind of research you're doing .__c8
__z__i think some researchers who are going to be working with this corpus years from now are really going to be cursing the fact that there's a bunch of stuff in there that's missing from the dialogue .__c8
__z__uhhuh .__c4
__z__you know it depends on the kind of research they're doing .__c8
__z__yeah .__c1
__z__but it might be uh it might be really a - a pain .__c8
__z__and you know where it's really going to hurt somebody in some way .__c8
__b__the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out .__c8
__z__but i really think we want to make it the rare incidence .__c8
__z__and - and uh i am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do .__c8
__z__and so much fun that they're going to go through and bleep out stuff .__c8
__z__so much fun .__cb
__z__and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too .__c8
__b__right ?__c8
__z__from somebody else as you say .__c8
__z__you know so well i didn't like what he said .__c8
__z__well i don't see any way of avoiding that .__c4
__z__i mean we have to provi- - we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like .__c4
__z__yeah .__c8
__z__so that the ==__c4
__z__no no i - i - i don't ==__c8
__z__the only question is ==__c4
__s.%--__you- - you've talked me into that .__c8
__qy^rt__but i - i just think that we should make it harder to do .__c8
__s.%--__the problem is if it's harder for them it's also harder for me .__c4
__qw__whereas this web interface i just get email .__c4
__z__it's all formatted .__c4
__z__it's all ready to go and i can just insert it .__c4
__z__so maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it .__c8
__b__well i guess ==__cb
__z__so - so - so ==__c8
__s__yeah .__cb
__z__i'm sorry .__c8
__s^t1__so - so - so maybe this is a s- - a way out of it .__c8
__z__huh .__cb
__b__you've provided something that's useful for you to do - handle .__c8
__z__and useful for someone else if they need it .__c8
__z__but i think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh they get access to this if they really need it .__c8
__b__well ==__c4
__z__so you're saying the - the sequence would be more like first adam goes to the contact lists contacts them via whatever their preferred method is to see if they want to review the meeting .__c2
__z__right .__c8
__z__and then if they don't you're done .__c2
__z__if they do then he provides them access to the - the web site .__c2
__z__w- - w- ==__c8
__s^bk|s^bu__well to some extent i have to do that anyway because as i said we have to distribute passwords .__c4
__z__or a printed out form .__c2
__z__there's - there ==__c8
__z__y- ==__c8
__s^bu^e__so ==__c4
__z__but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what i'm saying .__c8
__z__so ==__c8
__s^bk__well but ==__c4
__z__only if they want it .__c2
__z__what i'm saying is that i can't just email them the password because that's not secure .__c4
__z__no no no .__c8
__b__but you aren't necessarily giving them ==__c8
__z__so they have to call me and ask .__c4
__z__right .__c8
__z__but we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all .__c8
__z__huh ==__c1
__z__well we do because of privacy .__c4
__z__we can't just make it openly available on the web .__c4
__z__no no .__c8
__z__you're missing the point .__c8
__z__uhhuh .__cb
__z__we're - we're trying i- - we're trying to make it less of an obvious just l- - l- - l- - l- - uh fall off a log to do this .__c8
__s^bk__not everyone gets a password unless they ask for it .__cb
__z__right ?__c8
__b__so th- - so what i would see is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the ==__c8
__z__yeah .__cb
__z__not just for fun .__c8
__z__okay ?__c8
__z__but to - to check this for uh things that they're worried about having said or if they're willing to just send an approval of it at - from their memory .__c8
__z__um and uh | and we should think carefully - actually we should review - go through how that's worded .__c8
__z__okay ?__c8
__z__then if someone uh wants to review it uh ==__c8
__b__and i know you don't like this but i'm offering this as a suggestion | is that - is that we then give them a print out .__c8
__z__and then if they say that i have a potential problem with these things  then you - you say okay well you might want to hear this in context to s- - think if you need that you issue them a password i- - in the ==__c8
__z__but the - the problem with what you're suggesting is it's not just inconvenient for them it's inconvenient for me .__c4
__z__because that means multiple contacts every time - for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything .__c4
__z__i would much prefer to have all be automatic they visit the web site if they want to .__c4
__z__obviously they don't have to .__c4
__z__i know you'd prefer it | but the proble- ==__c8
__z__we have ==__c8
__z__yeah .__c4
__z__there's a problem with it .__c8
__z__so i think you're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and i just don't think that's going to happen .__c4
__z__i'm also concerned about the spirit of the - of the informed consent thing .__cb
__z__because i think if they feel that uh it's - i th- - i th- ==__cb
__z__you know if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that .__cb
__z__um | but - but they might be able to argue oh well it was cumbersome and i was busy and it was going to take me too much time to trace it down .__cb
__z__so it could that the burden would come back onto us .__cb
__z__so i'm a little bit worried about uh making it harder for them from the legal standpoint .__cb
__z__well you can go too far in that direction and you need to find somewhere between i think .__c8
__z__yeah .__cb
__z__because ==__c8
__z__it seems to me that sending them email saying if you have an o - okay reply to this email and say okay .__c4
__z__uhhuh .__c8
__z__if you have a problem with it contact me and i'll give you a password .__c4
__z__seems like is a perfectly reasonable compromise .__c4
__s^bk|s__and if they want a printout they can print it out themselves .__c4
__s__or we could print it up for them .__cb
__s__i mean we could offer that .__cb
__s^ba__yeah .__c1
__z__but - but there's uh another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form um my impression is that they - that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript .__cb
__fh__and - and i ha- ==__cb
__s^bk__i don't know that there's a chance of really skipping that stage .__cb
__s^t^tc__yeah .__c8
__s^t^tc__i mean i - i thought that you were ==__cb
__s__maybe i misinterpreted what you said but it's ==__cb
__s__having access to it doesn't necessarily mean that - having it .__c8
__s.%--__having it .__c4
__s.%--__giving it to them .__cb
__s.%--__right ?__c8
__s__okay .__cb
__s.%--__it just means they have the right to have it .__c8
__b__well the in ==__c4
__s^cs__all right .__cb
__%--__the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it .__c4
__s^cs__fine .__cb
__%--__okay .__cb
__s.%--__fair enough .__cb
__s^no__so ==__c4
__s.%--__yeah .__c8
__s__sh- - sh- ==__cb
__b__d- - you want me to grab one ?__c4
__s__well i could ==__cb
__s^ba__i'm closer .__cb
__%-__i could ==__cb
__s^nd__yeah | but you're wired .__c4
__s^ar__aren't you ?__c4
__s^df__yeah .__cb
__s^df__that is true .__cb
__b__um yeah | i mean i don't want to fool them .__c8
__s^df^e__i don't know ==__cb
__s^nd.%--__i just meant that e- - every - ev- - any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a - a bias that is presented .__c8
__s.%--__oh yeah yeah .__cb
__s__oh i know .__cb
__b__right ?__c8
__s^df__yeah that's true .__cb
__s.%--__of - and ==__c8
__b__if you agree to participate you'll have the opportunity to have anything ex- - anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set .__c4
__%--__yeah .__cb
__s^na__yeah .__c8
__s.%--__once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the r- - larger research community .__c4
__s^ng__there again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you'd prefer to have excised from the data base .__c4
__b__and they will m- - be removed both from the transcript and the recording .__c4
__s^nd.%--__huh .__cb
__s^bk__well that's more open than i realized .__cb
__s__well i mean it ==__c4
__s^aa__the one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said .__c4
__%-__i ==__c8
__%-__yeah .__c1
__s^aap__yeah uh no that - it - tha- ==__c8
__s^ar__tha- - that's true .__cb
__s^nd__that's more severe but the next one says the transcript will be around .__cb
__%-__that's right .__c8
__s^df__and it doesn't really say we'll send it to you .__cb
__s^aa__or wi- - it'll be available for you on the web or anything .__cb
__s^bk|s__i think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them .__c2
__s__i- - i ==__c8
__s__at least it more often .__cb
__b__yeah .__cb
__s^cs__it means also we don't have to g- - to give it to them .__cb
__s^df__i mean like - like morgan was saying they - they ==__cb
__s^bk|s^cs__they just have to make sure that it is available to them .__c4
__fg|%-__it's available to them if they ask for it .__cb
__qw__yeah okay .__c8
__fg__so wh- - um - i think i have an idea that may be sat- - may satisfy both you and me in this which is um ==__c8
__s__it's a - it - we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded .__c8
__s^df__so i - i just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre- - it gives very i mean nothing hidden v- - very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data .__c8
__s^cs.%--__right .__c4
__s^bk|%-__that - that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out .__c8
__s.%--__good .__cb
__%--__that it would be better for um our uh field if that is the case .__c8
__s__but if you really think something is going to ==__c8
__s__and i don't think there's anything in the legal aspects that - that is hurt by our expressing that bias .__c8
__s^ba__great .__cb
__fh__great great .__cb
__s^df__and then - then my concern about - which ==__c8
__s__yeah .__cb
__b__i agree .__cb
__s.%--__you know you might be right it may be it was just paranoia on my part uh but people just ==__c8
__s__see i'm @reject@ worried about this interface so much fun that people start bleeping stuff out just as - just because they can .__c8
__s^e__it's just a check box next to the text it's not any fun at all .__c4
__s^bd^df__yeah .__c8
__s^df__well i don't know .__c8
__fg|s__i kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out .__c8
__b__you know ?__c8
__s.%--__i ==__c8
__s__well but they won't get that feedback .__c4
__s__all ==__c4
__b__oh they won't ?__c8
__s__no | because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the time .__c4
__s__oh good .__c8
__fh__it just sends me ==__c4
__b__so you haven't made it so much fun .__c8
__s__right .__c4
__s.%--__oh good .__c8
__%--__okay .__c8
__s^fa|s__it just sends me the time intervals .__c4
__fh__and then at some point i'll incorporate them all and put bleeps .__c4
__s__i mean i don't want to have t- - ha- - do that yet until we actually release the data .__c4
__s__yeah .__c8
__qy__because um then we have to have two copies of every meeting .__c4
__qy__and we're already short on disk space .__c4
__s^bk|s^bu__yeah .__c8
__s^df^na__so i - i - want to - i - just keep the times until we actually want to release the data and .__c4
__s__then we bleep it .__c4
__b__okay .__c8
__s__all right so i think ==__c8
__b__yeah so if we have if - i- ==__c8
__s^t1.%__again let's you know sort of circulate the - the wording on each of these things and get it right .__c8
__z__but - but ==__c8
__%-__well since you seem to feel heart- - uh strongest about it would you like to do the first pass ?__c4
__s^cs__okay .__c8
__s__uh fair enough .__c8
__s__turn about is fair play .__c8
__qh__al- - also it- - ther- - there is this other question the legal question that - that adam's raised uh - about whether we need a concrete signature or email c- - i- - suffices or whatever .__cb
__%-__sorry .__c8
__s^bu__yeah .__c4
__fg|s__and i don't know how that works .__cb
__qy^d^g^rt__i- - there's something down there about if you agree to ==__cb
__s^cs__i'm - i'm - i'm - i thought - i - i thought about it with one of my background processes .__c8
__s__i don't think so .__c4
__fg|s__and i - uh it's - uh it's uh it's fine to do the email .__c8
__s__uh .__cb
__s__fine .__cb
__s__good .__cb
__s^bk|s__okay .__c8
__fh__yeah | because thi- - th- - they're signing here that they're agreeing to the paragraph which says you'll be given an opportunity .__c4
__%-__okay .__cb
__s__yeah .__c8
__fg|%-__and ==__c8
__s__and so i don't think they need another signature .__c4
__fh__well and furthermore i ==__c8
__s__it's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that i do with people on contracts and so forth .__c8
__s__that - that uh if it's - if it's that sort of thing where you're - you're saying uh okay i agree we want eighty hours of this person at such and such amount and i agree that's okay .__c8
__s.%--__uh | if it's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it's often done in email now .__c8
__s__right .__c4
__s.%--__so it's - it's okay .__c8
__s^df__great .__cb
__%-__um ==__c8
__qy^bu^d^j^rt__so i guess i probably should at the minimum think about how to present it in a printed form .__c4
__%-__i'm not really sure what's best with that .__c4
__s^aa|s__the problem is a lot of them are really short .__c4
__s__well ==__cb
__fh__and so i don't necessarily want to do one per line .__c4
__s.%-__well i s- ==__cb
__s^aa|s.%--__but i don't know how else to do it .__c4
__fh__i also have this ==__cb
__s.%--__i - i think it's nice you have it uh viewab- - her- - hearable on the - on the web for those who might wonder about um the non - nonverbal side .__cb
__s__i mean i - i agree that our bias should be as - as expressed here .__cb
__s__and - but i - i think it's nice that a person could check .__cb
__b__because sometimes you know you - the words on a - on the page come out soun- - sounding different in terms of the social dynamics if they hear it .__cb
__s__huh .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c8
__b__and i realize we shouldn't emphasize that people you know shouldn't borrow trouble .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__%-__what it comes down to but ==__cb
__fg|s^cs__yeah i think actually ==__c4
__b__my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh - not good .__c4
__s.%--__you know if - if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that .__c4
__s__oh you know or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole uh i- - segment a- - against some - personal i- - th- ==__cb
__s__right .__c4
__s__that was all mumbled ?__c4
__qy__i think microsoft is ==__c4
__s^aa|s^na__yeah .__c1
__s^cs__yeah exactly .__cb
__s^na__oh .__c1
__fg|s__@reject@ sorry transcribers .__c4
__s__@reject@ or - or even - or even there was a - a line you know about how huh uhhuh bill gates duh duh duh duh ==__cb
__s__yeah .__c8
__b__but - but it was all - the words were all visible but they didn't end up i- - some- - there was a slip in the transcript .__cb
__s__oh god .__c1
__%-__@reject@ they're going to hate this meeting .__c4
__fh__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah that's true .__cb
__b__actually liz will like it .__c4
__s__know but ==__c4
__s.%--__liz will like it .__c8
__fh__we had a pretty strong disagreement going there .__c8
__s__yep yep that's right .__c4
__s__yeah .__c8
__s.%--__yeah .__cb
__s^e__so i don't know .__cb
__s__i mean i - i guess we're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that - that my double checking will be so close to absolutely perfect that it - that nothing will slip by .__cb
__s^df__uhhuh .__c4
__s__but it - the ==__c8
__s.%--__some- - something might sometime and they - uh ==__c8
__b__if - if it's something that they said they might ==__c8
__s.%--__i- - i- ==__c8
__s.%--__i mean you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said .__c8
__s.%--__uhhuh .__cb
__s__but when they hear it themselves they may hear something different because they know what they meant .__c8
__s__i don't know how to notate that .__cb
__s__sarcasm .__c2
__s__yeah that's right .__cb
__s^ba__how do you - how do you indicate sarcasm ?__c2
__s.%--__yeah that's right .__cb
__z__no i'm serious .__c8
__s^ba__so the - so - i- - the ==__c8
__s__so we might - we might get some feedback from people that such and such was you know not - not really what i said .__c8
__s^bk|s^ba__yeah .__c4
__qw__well that would be good to get definitely .__c4
__s^df.%--__yeah but ==__c8
__s^bd__yeah sure .__c8
__s.%--__just for corrections .__c4
__s.%-__yeah .__c8
__s^bd__so um in terms of password distribution i think phone is really the only way to do it .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__phone and in person .__c4
__%-__yeah .__cb
__s^bk|s^df__or mail physical mail .__c4
__%-__or if for- ==__cb
__s__leave it on their voice mail .__cb
__s.%--__any sub word level thing .__c2
__s__@reject@ .__c2
__s__any sub wor- ==__c4
__s^df__yeah okay .__c4
__b__i mean you could do it with p g p or things like that but it's too complex .__c4
__s__you know i just realized something which is of - e- - th- - this question about the - uh the possible mismatch of ==__cb
__s__i mean i- ==__cb
__s__well and actually also the lawyer saying that um we shouldn't really have them - have the people believing that they will be cleared by our checks .__cb
__s__you know ?__cb
__fh__i mean so it's like i- - in a way it's - it's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and - and hear the transcript .__cb
__s^df__uhhuh .__c8
__s__to have that be the ==__cb
__b__well yeah | but you can't dep- ==__c8
__s^bk__i mean most people will not want to take the time to do that though .__c8
__%--__yeah okay fair enough .__cb
__s.%--__and they're s- - they're absorbing the responsibility themselves .__cb
__s__and they - they have to ==__c8
__s__so it's not - it's not um ==__cb
__b__yeah good .__cb
__b__but i mean if you were at a meeting and - and you - you don't think at least that you said anything funny .__c8
__s__and the meeting was about you know some - some funny thing about semantics or something or uh ==__c8
__z__you probably won't listen to it .__c4
__s^df__yeah .__c8
__z__it is true that tec- - that the content is technical .__cb
__b__i - and so i- - and we're not having these discussions which ==__cb
__fh__yeah .__c8
__s__i - i mean when i listen to these things i don't find things that are questionable in other people's speech or in my own .__cb
__s^cs__you would think it would be rare .__c8
__s^cs__just ==__cb
__s^bk|s__it should be very rare .__cb
__s^df__i mean we're not talking about the energy crisis or something people have ==__c8
__z__yeah .__cb
__s^aa__yeah okay .__cb
__s^bk__how about them energy crises ?__c4
__qy^rt^t^tc__yeah .__c8
__s^aa__i think we're uh ==__c8
____done ?__c4
____kind of done .__c8
____actually i was going to ==__c8
____di- - did you have anything n- - that's going on or ?==__c8
____not really .__c5
____no .__c5
____um | my project is going along .__c5
__z__but um i'm really just here to um fill the project uh the overall progress .__c5
__z__yeah .__c8
__z__i don't really have anything specific to - to talk about .__c5
