__s.%-__@reject@ okay .__c4
____we're on again ?__c3
____okay .__c3
____uhhuh .__c0
____that is really great .__c0
____yeah so if uh - so if anyone hasn't signed the consent form please do so .__cb
____okay- ==__c3
____oh yeah !__c1
____that's terrific .__c0
__s^bk__the new consent form .__cb
__s^bu|qy^d^g__the new and improved consent form .__cb
__s.%-__now you won't be able to walk or ride your bike huh ?__c0
__s^ar__uh .__c8
__s^ar|s__okay .__c3
__fg|s__okay .__c3
__s^na__right .__c1
__s__and uh shall i go ahead and do some digits ?__cb
__s__uh | we were going to do that at the end .__c3
__s^df.%-__remember ?__c3
__s__okay | whatever you want .__cb
__s^e.%-__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__just - just to be consistent from here on in at least that - that we'll do it at the end .__c3
__s^aa__the new consent form .__c1
__b.%__it's uh - yeah it doesn't matter .__cb
__b.%__okay .__cb
__s__okay .__c3
__s__testing one two three .__c8
__s__um | well it ju- - i mean it might be that someone here has to go .__c3
__s^aa|s__and ==__c3
__s__right ?__c3
__s.%-__that was - that was sort of the point .__c3
__s__so uh | i had asked actually anybody who had any ideas for an agenda to send it to me and no one did .__c3
__qy^rt^t^tc__so ==__c3
__qy^e.%-__so we all forgot .__cb
__s^aa__uh ==__c3
__s^bk|s__from last time i wanted to - uh the - an iss- - uh one topic from last time .__c8
__s^bk__right .__c3
__b__s- - okay so one item for an agenda is uh jane has some uh uh some research to talk about research issues .__c3
__fh|qw^t__um and uh | adam has some short research issues .__c3
__s^t__and i have some short research issues .__cb
__qy^rt__um i have a list of things that i think were done over the last three months .__c3
__fg|qy^rt__i was supposed to send off uh and um i - i sent a note about it to uh - to adam and jane .__c3
__s.%--__but i think i'll just run through it also and see if someone thinks it's inaccurate or uh insufficient .__c3
__s^ba__a list that you have to send off to who ?__c0
__%--__uh to uh | uh i b m .__c3
__s^na__oh .__c0
__s__@reject@ .__c4
__s__okay .__c3
__fh__they're you know ==__c3
__s^df__so ==__c3
__s.%__um so uh | so i'll go through that .__c3
__s^ar|s.%-__um | and anything else anyone wants to talk about ?__c3
__s^cs__no .__c3
__qw.%-__okay .__c3
__s^bk|s^df^nd__what about the um - your trip yesterday ?__c0
__s.%__um .__c3
__%__sort of off topic i guess .__c3
__qw__because that's because that was all - all about the uh ==__c3
__s__oh okay .__c0
__s__i - i - i can chat with you about that off line .__c3
__s^cs__that's another thing .__c3
__s^fe__um | and anything else ?__c3
__s.%--__nothing else ?__c3
__s^f__uh | there's a - i mean there is a - a um uh telephone call tomorrow which will be a conference call that some of us are involved in for uh a possible proposal .__c3
__b__um we'll talk - we'll talk about it next week if - if something ==__c3
__qy.%--__do you want me to be there for that ?__cb
__s__i noticed you c c'ed me but i wasn't actually a recipient .__cb
__%-__i didn't quite know what to make of that .__cb
__%--__uh | well we'll talk - talk about that after our meeting .__c3
__s^bk|s__okay .__cb
__s^na__okay .__c3
__b__uh okay .__c3
__s__so it sounds like the - the three main things that we have to talk about are uh this list uh jane and - jane and adam have some research items and other than that anything as usual anything goes beyond that .__c3
__b__okay | uh jane since - since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours ?__c3
__s.%-__make sure we get to it .__c3
__s^bk|s__okay it's - it's very uh - it's very brief i mean - just let me - just hand these out .__c8
__s^aa|s^cs__oops !__c8
__b__is this the same as the e mail or different ?__cb
__s^ba__it's slightly different .__c8
__s^bk__thanks .__c2
__s^ba__i - basically the same .__c8
__%--__okay .__cb
__%--__same idea ?__c0
__s^bk__but same idea .__c8
__b__so if you've looked at this you've seen it before .__c8
__b__so basically um as you know uh part of the encoding includes a mark that indicates an overlap .__c8
__b__it's not indicated with um uh tight precision it's just indicated that - okay so it's indicated to - to - so the people know what parts of sp- - which - which stretches of speech were in the clear versus being overlapped by others .__c8
__qw__so i used this mark and um and uh uh divided the ==__c8
__s.%--__i wrote a script which divides things into individual minutes of which we ended up with forty five and a little bit .__c8
__s^ba__and uh you know minute zero of course is the first minute up to sixty seconds .__c8
__s^bk__okay .__c2
__s^bk__and um what you can see is the number of overlaps and then to the right whether they involve two speakers three speakers or more than three speakers .__c8
__s^t^tc__and um and | what i was looking for sp- - sp- - specifically was the question of whether they're distributed evenly throughout or whether they're bursts of them .__c8
__s__um .__c8
__%-__and it looked to me as though ==__c8
__s__uh you know - y- - this is just - uh - uh this would - this is not statistically verified but it did look to me as though there are bursts throughout rather than being localized to a particular region .__c8
__qh.%--__the part down there where there's the maximum number of - of um overlaps is an area where we were discussing whether or not it would be useful to indi- - to s- - to code stress uh sentence stress as possible indication of uh information retrieval .__c8
__fh__so it's like you know rather lively discussion there .__c8
__qh__what was - what's the - the parenthesized stuff that says like - e- - the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ?__c3
__%-__oh .__c8
__s__th- - that's the per cent .__c8
__s^m^na__huh .__c3
__s__so six is uh two point eight per cent of the total number of overlaps in the session .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__fh__uh .__c3
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c2
__s.%--__at the very end this is when people were you know packing up to go basically .__c8
__s.%--__there's this final stuff .__c8
__s^df^no__i think we - i don't remember where the digits fell .__c8
__qy^bu^d^rt__i'd have to look at that .__c8
__s^bu^m^rt__but the final three there are no overlaps at all .__c8
__s__and couple times there are not .__c8
__s__so i- - it seems like it goes through bursts but um that's kind of it .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s__now another question is is there - are there individual differences in whether you're likely to be overlapped with or to overlap with others .__c8
__s^aap__and again i want to emphasize this is just one particular um - one particular meeting and also there's been no statistical testing of it all but i um i took the coding of the ==__c8
__s:s__i you know my - i had this script figure out um who was the first speaker who was the second speaker involved in a two person overlap i didn't look at the ones involving three or more .__c8
__b__and um this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of who tended to be overlapping most often with who - who else .__c8
__s__and if you look at the marginal totals which is the ones on the right side and across the bottom you get the totals for an individual .__c8
__s__so um if you look at the bottom those are the um numbers of overlaps in which um adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look ==__c8
__b__i'm sorry but you're o- - alphabetical that's why i'm choosing you .__c8
__s^df^nd__and then if you look across the right then that's where he was the person who was the sp- - first speaker in the pair and got overlap - overlapped with by somebody .__c8
__s^f__huh !__c0
__s^aa|s__uhhuh .__c4
__s^df__and then if you look down in the summary table then you see that um th- - they're differences in whether a person got overlapped with or overlapped by .__c8
__s^aa__is this uh just raw counts or is it ?==__cb
__%--__raw counts .__c8
__s__so it would be interesting to see how much each person spoke .__cb
__%-__uhhuh .__c1
__s^ba__yes very true - very true .__c8
__s^df__yeah yeah .__c4
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s^e__normalized to how much ==__cb
__s^aa|s^cs__it would be good to normalize with respect to that .__c8
__b__now on the table i did take one step toward uh away from the raw frequencies by putting uh percentages .__c8
__s^cs^e__so that the percentage of time of the - of the times that a person spoke what percentage uh w- ==__c8
__s__so of the times a person spoke and furthermore was involved in a two - two person overlap what percentage of the time were they the overlapper and what percent of the time were they th- - the overlappee ?__c8
__fh__and there it looks like you see some differences .__c8
__s__um that some people tend to be overlapped with more often than they're overlapped .__c8
__s^bk__but of course uh i- - e- - this is just one meeting uh there's no statistical testing involved and that would be required for a - for a finding of any kind of scientific reliability .__c8
__s^bk__s- - so i- - it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that adam talked too much or something .__c3
__s^t^tc__no - no | actually that would be actually statistically correct .__cb
__s__no no no .__c8
__s^aa__yeah yeah .__c3
__s^m^na__yeah yeah .__c4
__s__but ==__cb
__qy^rt__yeah yeah .__c4
__s^ar|s^nd.%--__yeah that's right .__c8
__s^ar|s^df__that's right .__c8
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s^aa|s^rt__and i'm you know i'm - i don't see a point of singling people out .__c8
__fh__excuse me .__c3
__qw^t1__now this is a case where obviously ==__c8
__s__b- - i - i - i rather enjoyed it but - but this ==__c3
__s^rt__but the numbers speak for themselves .__c0
__s__he's - yeah yeah yeah .__c4
__s__yes that's right | so you don't nee- - okay .__cb
__s__well you know it's like - i'm not - i'm not saying on the tape who did better or worse .__c8
__s__because i don't think that it's ==__c8
__s__sure .__c3
__s__i - you know ==__c8
__qy__and - and th- - here's a case where of course human subjects people would say be sure that you anonymize the results and - | and so might as well do this .__c8
__qy.%--__yeah when - this is what - this is actually - when jane sent this e mail first is what caused me to start thinking about anonymizing the data .__cb
__s^ar__yeah .__c3
__s^j.%--__well fair enough .__c8
__qy^cs^rt__fair enough .__c8
__s^cc__and actually you know the point is not about an individual it's the point about tendencies toward you know different styles different speaker styles .__c8
__s^bk|s__yeah .__c3
__s__oh sure .__c3
__s__and it would be you know of course there's also the question of what type of overlap was this and w- - what were they .__c8
__s__and i- - and i - and i know that i can distinguish at least three types and probably more .__c8
__s__i mean the general cultural idea which w- - uh the conversation analysts originally started with in the seventies was that we have this strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish th- - before you start talking .__c8
__s__and and you know i mean w- - we know that - an- - and they've loosened up on that too s- - in the intervening time that that that's - that's viewed as being a culturally relative thing .__c8
__s__i mean that you have the high involvement style from the east coast where people will overlap often as an indication of interest in what the other person is saying .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__cb
__s__and ==__c8
__s^bk__yeah exactly !__c8
__s^ft.%__exactly !__c1
__s__well there you go .__c8
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__fine that's all right that's okay .__c8
__fh__and - and you know in contrast so deborah - d- - and also deborah tannen's thesis .__c8
__s__she talked about differences of these types that they're just different styles .__c8
__b__and it's um you - you can't impose a model of - there - of the ideal being no overlaps .__c8
__s__and you know conversational analysts also agree with that .__c8
__qy^rt__so it's now universally a- - ag- - agreed with .__c8
__s.%--__and - and als- ==__c8
__s^df^e.%--__i mean i can't say universally .__c8
__s__but anyway the people who used to say it was strict um now uh don't .__c8
__s__i mean they - they also you know uh uh ack- - acknowledge the influence of sub- - of subcultural norms and cross cultural norms and things .__c8
__b__so um then it beco- - though - so - just - just superficially to give um a couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved i have at the bottom several that i noticed .__c8
__s^aa__so uh there are backchannels like what adam just did now .__c8
__s^bk__and um um | anticipating the end of a question and simply answering it earlier .__c8
__s^aa__and there are several of those in this - in these data where ==__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s^ba__because we're people who've talked to each other .__c8
__b.%__um we know basically what the topic is what the possibilities are and w- - and we've spoken with each other .__c8
__s^bk__so we know basically what the other person's style is likely to be .__c8
__s__and so and t- - there are a number of places where someone just answered early .__c8
__s__no problem .__c8
__fh__and places also which i thought were interesting where two or more people gave exactly th- - the same answer in unison - different words of course .__c8
__s^aap__but you know the - basically you know everyone's saying yes or - you know or ev- - even more sp- - specific than that .__c8
__s^aa|s^na__so uh the point is that um overlap's not necessarily a bad thing and that it would be im- - i- - useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved .__c8
__s^aa__and that's all i wanted to say on that unless people have questions .__c8
__s^bk__well of course th- - the biggest um result here which is one we've - we've talked about many times and isn't new to us but which i think would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this is just the sheer number of overlaps .__c3
__s^na__yep .__cb
__s__yes yes !__c4
__b.%__oh okay - | interesting .__c8
__fg|s^t^tc__that - that - right - that - that um ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c4
__s.%__here's a relatively short meeting .__c3
__fg__it's a forty - forty plus minute meeting .__c3
__%--__and not only were there two hundred and fifteen overlaps but uh i think there's one - one minute there where there - where - where there wasn't any overlap .__c3
__s__hundred ninety seven .__cb
__s__i mean it's - uh throughout this thing .__c3
__qh__well at the bottom you have the bottom three .__c8
__qh__it's - you have ==__c3
__qh__s- - n- - are ==__cb
__qh__it'd be interesting ==__c0
__s__yeah .__c4
__%-__so four - four minutes all together with none - none .__c8
__qh^e__oh so the bottom three did have s- - stuff going on ?__c3
__s__but it w- ==__c0
__s^aa__yes uhhuh .__c8
__b__there was speech .__c3
__s.%--__yeah .__c8
__s__but just no overlaps .__c8
__s^aa__okay so if - the - this ==__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__it'd be interesting to see what the total amount of time is in the overlaps versus ==__c0
__s^e__yes exactly | and that's - that's where jose's pro- - project comes in .__c8
__b__i was about to ask ==__ca
__fh__yeah yeah i h- - i have this- - that infor- - i have th- - that information now .__c4
__%--__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__huh .__c1
__s__oh about how much is it ?__c3
__s.%--__the - the duration of uh - of each of the overlaps .__c4
__s__o- - oh what's - what's the - what's the average length ?__c3
__s__m- - i - i haven't averaged it now .__c4
__qh^df.%-__but uh i - i will uh i will do the - the study of the - with the - with the program with the - uh the different uh the nnn distribution of the duration of the overlaps .__c4
__s__you don't know ?__c3
__s__okay you - you don- - you don't have a feeling for roughly how much it is ?__c3
__qy^d^rt__huh because the - the uh budget is horrid .__c4
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^e__the duration is uh the variation - the variation of the duration is uh very big on the dat- ==__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__%-__uhhuh .__c0
__s__i suspect that it will also differ depending on the type of overlap involved .__c8
__b__but uh ==__c4
__s^bd^df__yeah .__c4
__s^bd^e:s__so backchannels will be very brief .__c8
__b__oh i'm sure .__c3
__s__because on your surface uh a bit of zone of overlapping with the duration uh overlapped and another very very short .__c4
__%-__and ==__c8
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s^e__uh i- - probably it's very difficult to - to - because the - the overlap is uh on- - is only the - in the final s of the - of the - the fin- - the - the end - the end word of the um previous speaker with the - the next word of the - the new speaker .__c4
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c0
__s^df^no:s__um i considered that's an overlap but it's very short it's an x with a - and - the idea is probably uh when uh - when uh we studied th- - th- - that zone uh uh we h- - we have uh uh confusion with uh uh noise .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__s^df^e:s__with uh that fricative sounds but uh i have new information but i have to - to study .__c4
__%__yeah .__c3
__s^df^ng__yeah | but i - i'd - u- ==__c3
__s^e__can i ==__ca
__%-__go ahead .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c8
__%-__you split this by minute um so if an overlap straddles the boundary between two minutes that counts towards both of those minutes .__ca
__s__yes .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__s__actually um um actually not .__c8
__s__uh so le- - let's think about the case where a starts speaking and then b overlaps with a and then the minute boundary happens .__c8
__s^df__and let's say that after that minute boundary um b is still speaking and a overlaps with b .__c8
__qw__that would be a new overlap .__c8
__s^cs__but otherwise um let's say b comes to the conclusion of - of that turn without anyone overlapping with him or her .__c8
__s^aa|s^ba__in which case there would be no overlap counted in that second minute .__c8
__s^ba__no but suppose they both talk simultaneously both a - a portion of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two .__ca
__b__okay .__c8
__qh^cs__in that case um my c- - the coding that i was using - since we haven't uh incorporated adam's uh coding of overlap yets the coding of ==__c8
__s^aap__yeah yets is not a word .__c8
__s^nd.%--__uh since we haven't incorporated adam's method of handling overl- - overlaps yet um then that would have fallen through the cra- - cracks .__c8
__qh^df^ng__it would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because um i wou- - i wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was encoded so far .__c8
__s__we just haven't done th- - the precise second to sec- - you know second to second coding of when they occur .__c8
__b__i- - i- ==__c3
__qy^d^f^g__i- - i- ==__c3
__s^aa__i'm - i'm - i'm confused now .__c3
__s^df__so l- - l- - let me restate what i thought andreas was saying and - and see .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__%-__let's say that in - in second fifty seven of one minute you start talking and i start talking and we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds .__c3
__s__yep .__c8
__%-__okay .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__s^e__so we go over - so we were - we were talking over one another and it's just - in each case it's just sort of one interval .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c8
__s__right ?__c3
__s__so um | we talked over the minute boundary .__c3
__s__is this considered as one overlap in each of the minutes the way you have done this ?__c3
__s__no it wouldn't .__c8
__s^cs__it would be considered as an overlap in the first one .__c8
__%-__okay so that's good i- - i think in the sense that i think andreas meant the question .__c3
__s^cs^e__that's - that's good | yeah because the overall rate is ==__c1
__s__yeah .__ca
__s^e__hmph .__c2
__s^aa__statistical .__cb
__s^e.%--__yeah .__c1
__s__yep .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__b__other- - otherwise you'd get double counts here and there .__ca
__s^e__right ?__c3
__b__yeah .__c8
__s__they're not double counted .__c8
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__uh but yeah .__c1
__b__and then it would be harder .__ca
__s^2__@reject@ .__c1
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s__i should also say i did a simplifying uh count in that if a was speaking b overlapped with a and then a came back again and overlapped with b again .__c8
__s__i - i didn't count that as a three person overlap i counted that as a two person overlap and it was a being overlapped with by d .__c8
__b__uhhuh .__cb
__s^bk__because the idea was the first speaker had the floor and the second person started speaking and then the f- - the first person reasserted the floor kind of thing .__c8
__s__these are simplifying assumptions .__c8
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__didn't happen very often .__c8
__s__there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing .__c8
__b__i want to go back and listen to minute forty one .__cb
__s^df.%--__yeah yeah .__c8
__s^ba__because i- - i- - i find it interesting that there were a large number of overlaps and they were all two speaker .__cb
__s^cs__yeah .__c3
__%-__i mean what i thought - what i would have thought in is that when there were a large number of overlaps it was because everyone was talking at once but uh apparently not .__cb
__b__that's interesting .__c8
__b__that's interesting .__c8
__s^cs^e__yeah .__c4
__s^ba__yeah .__c4
__%-__huh .__c4
__s.%--__that's really neat .__cb
__s^bd^df__yeah there's a lot of backchannel a lot o- - a lot of ==__c8
__s^bu|qy^d^g__yeah .__c3
__fg|s^df__this is really interesting data .__cb
__s.%-__yeah it is .__c8
__s^df^e__i think so too i think .__c8
__s.%-__i think what's really interesting though it is before d- - saying yes meetings have a lot of overlaps is to actually find out how many more we have than two party .__c1
__s^bk__because in two party conversations like switchboard there's an awful lot too if you just look at backchannels if you consider those overlaps .__c1
__s.%--__it's also ver- - it's huge .__c1
__%-__it's just that people haven't been looking at that because they've been doing single channel processing for speech recognition .__c1
__%__uhhuh .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^rt__so the question is you know how many more overlaps do you have of say the two person type by adding more people to a meeting .__c1
__s__and it may be a lot more but i- - it may - it may not be .__c1
__b__well | but see i find it interesting even if it wasn't any more .__c3
__s__so ==__c1
__s^df__because since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in switchboard where it was just all separated out we just - everything was just nice .__c3
__s^df^ng__uhhuh .__c1
__qy^d^g__so that - so the issue is in - in a situation where th- - that's ==__c3
__s.%-__well it's not really nice .__c1
__s^aa__it depends what you're doing .__c1
__s__so if you were actually having ==__c1
__s__uh ==__c1
__s__depends what you're doing .__c1
__s__if - right now we're do- - we have individual mikes on the people in this meeting .__c1
__s^am__uhhuh .__c3
__%-__so the question is you know - are there really more overlaps happening than there would be in a two person party .__c1
__s__let - let m- - let me rephrase what i'm saying because i don't think i'm getting it across .__c3
__%-__and - and there well may be but ==__c1
__s^aa__what - what i - what - i shouldn't use words like nice because maybe that's too - i- - too imprecise .__c3
__s^aa__but what i mean is that um in switchboard despite the many - many other problems that we have one problem that we're not considering is overlap .__c3
__s^na__and what we're doing now is aside from the many other differences in the task we are considering overlap .__c3
__s__and one of the reasons that we're considering it you know one of them not all of them one of them is that w- - uh at least you know i'm very interested in the scenario in which uh both people talking are pretty much equally audible and from a single microphone .__c3
__s__and so in that case it does get mixed in and it's pretty hard to jus- - to just ignore it to just do processing on one and not on the other .__c3
__fh__i - i agree that it's an issue here but it's also an issue for switchboard .__c1
__b__and if you think of meetings being recorded over the telephone which i think you know this whole point of studying meetings isn't just to have people in a room but to also have meetings over different phone lines .__c1
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c3
__s__maybe far field mike people wouldn't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s.%-__so if each of us was calling and having a meeting that way you kn- - you know like a conference call .__c1
__b__and just the question is y- - you know in switchboard you would think that's the simplest case of a meeting of more than one person .__c1
__fg|s^df__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__and i'm wondering how much more overlap of the types that - that jane described happen with more people present .__c1
__s^df__so it may be that having three people is very different from having two people or it may not be .__c1
__s.%--__that's an important question to ask .__c3
__s__i think what i'm - all i'm s- - really saying is that i don't think we were considering that in switchboard .__c3
__s__so ==__c1
__s:qw__not you me .__c1
__%-__were you ?==__c3
__s^cs.%--__though it wasn't in the design .__cb
__s__but uh - but - but ==__c1
__b__were you - were you - were you - were you measuring it ?__c3
__s^e__i mean w- - w- - were ==__c3
__s__there - there's ==__c1
__b.%__actually to tell you the truth the reason why it's hard to measure is because of ==__c1
__s__so from the point of view of studying dialogue i mean which dan jurafsky and andreas and i had some projects on you want to know the sequence of turns .__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__so what happens is if you're talking and i have a backchannel in the middle of your turn and then you keep going what it looks like in a dialogue model is your turn and then my backchannel .__c1
__s:qw__yeah .__c3
__fg|s^ba^nd__even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn .__c1
__s^df__yeah .__c3
__%-__so for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling it's - we know that that's wrong in real time .__c1
__s.%-__yeah .__c3
__s__but because of the acoustic segmentations that were done and the fact that some of the acoustic data in switchboard were missing people couldn't study it .__c1
__b__but that doesn't mean in the real world that people don't talk that way .__c1
__s^e__yeah | i wasn't saying that .__c3
__s__so | it's - um ==__c1
__s__right ?__c3
__s__i was just saying that w- - now we're looking at it .__c3
__s__well we've als- ==__c1
__s^e__and - and - and you - you maybe wanted to look at it before but for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you weren't .__c3
__s__right .__c1
__fh__we're looking at it here .__c1
__s__so that's why it's coming to us as new .__c3
__s.%--__even though it may well be you know if your - if your hypothes- - the hypothesis you were offering uh ==__c3
__b__um .__c1
__s^no__right if it's the null poth- - hypothesis and if actually you have as much overlap in a two person we don't know the answer to that .__c3
__s__the reason we don't know the answer to is because it wasn't studied and it wasn't studied because it wasn't set up right .__c3
__b__yeah | all i meant is that if you're asking the question from the point of view of what's different about a meeting studying meetings of say more than two people versus what kinds of questions you could ask with a two person meeting .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s^e__it's important to distinguish that you know this project is getting a lot of overlap but other projects were too but we just couldn't study them .__c1
__s^aa|s^na__may have been .__c3
__b__and and so uh ==__c1
__s__may have been .__c3
__s^df^e:qy__right ?__c3
__s.%--__we do kn- - we don't know the numbers .__c3
__b__well | there is a high rate .__c1
__s__so ==__c1
__s^aa__it's - but i don't know how high in fact .__c1
__s^aa__well here- - i have a question .__c0
__s^df__that would be interesting to know .__c1
__b__see i mean i- - i- - le- - let me t- ==__c3
__s__i mean my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody what have we learned about overlaps here .__c3
__s.%-__just never mind comparison with something else .__c3
__s^cs^df__uhhuh .__c1
__s^aa__what we've learned about is overlaps in this situation is that - the first - the first order thing i would say is that there's a lot of them .__c3
__b__yeah .__c4
__s:qw__right ?__c3
__b__in - in the sense that i- - if you said if - i- - i- - i- ==__c3
__s__yeah i - i don't di- - i agree with that .__c1
__s^df__in a way i guess what i'm comparing to is more the common sense notion of how - how much people overlap .__c3
__s^aa__uh | you know the fact that when - when - when uh adam was looking for a stretch of - of speech before that didn't have any overlaps and he w- - he was having such a hard time .__c3
__s^aa__and now i look at this and i go well i can see why he was having such a hard time .__c3
__s.%--__right .__c1
__s__that's also true of switchboard .__c1
__s:s__it's happening a lot .__c3
__s__i wasn't saying it wasn't .__c3
__s__it may not be ==__c1
__s^e__right .__c1
__b.%__so it's just um ==__c1
__s.%-__right ?__c3
__s^ba^df^ng__i was commenting about this .__c3
__s^e__okay .__c1
__s^cs__i'm saying if i - i'm saying if i have this complicated thing in front of me and we sh- - which you know we're going to get much more sophisticated about when we get lots more data .__c3
__%-__all i'm saying is that from the ==__c1
__s^ar__but - then if i was going to describe to somebody what did you learn right here about you know the - the modest amount of data that was analyzed i'd say well the first order thing was there was a lot of overlaps .__c3
__s^df__in fact - and it's not just an overlap - bunch of overlaps - second order thing is it's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point but that there's overlaps uh throughout the thing .__c3
__qw^br^m__right .__cb
__b__and that's interesting .__c3
__s^e__right .__c1
__s^ar|s^df.%--__no i - i agree with that .__c1
__%-__that's all .__c3
__s__i'm just saying that it may - the reason you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the number of people in the meeting .__c1
__s__oh yeah .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__and that's all .__c1
__s^df__yeah i wasn't making any statement about that .__c3
__b__and - and it would actually be interesting to find out .__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__because some of the data say switchboard which isn't exactly the same kind of context .__c1
__s^cs__i mean these are two people who don't know each other and so forth .__c1
__s^cs^e__but we should still be able to somehow say what - what is the added contra- - contribution to sort of overlap time of each additional person or something like that .__c1
__b__yep .__cb
__b.%__i could certainly see it going either way .__cb
__s^nd__yeah | that would be good to know .__c3
__s__okay now .__c8
__s^rt__what ==__c0
__s__but w- - we ==__c3
__s__wh- - yeah i - i agree - i agree with adam .__c8
__b__but yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__and the reason is because i think there's a limit - there's an upper bound on how many you can have simply from the standpoint of audibility .__c8
__b__when we speak we - we do make a judgment of can - you know as adults .__c8
__qh__uhhuh .__c3
__s__right .__c1
__s__i mean children don't adjust so well .__c8
__%-__i mean if a truck goes rolling past adults will - well depending but mostly adults will - will - will hold off to what - to finish the end of the sentence till the - till the noise is past .__c8
__s^ng__uhhuh .__c3
__s.%--__and i think we generally do monitor things like that about - whether we - whether our utterance will be in the clear or not .__c8
__s.%--__right .__c1
__s__and partly it's related to rhythmic structure in conversation .__c8
__s^ba^bd__so you know you - you t- - yeah this is d- - also um people tend to time their - their - their um when they come into the conversation based on the overall rhythmic uh uh ambient thing .__c8
__s^df__well ==__c0
__s.%--__right .__c1
__s__so you don't want to be c- - cross cutting .__c8
__s__and - and just to finish this that um - that i think that there may be an upper bound on how many overlaps you can have simply from the standpoint of audibility and how loud the other people are who are already in the fray .__c8
__s__but i - you know of certain types .__c8
__s__now if it's just backchannels people may be doing that with less intention of being heard just sort of spontaneously doing backchannels .__c8
__s:qw__in which case that - those might - there may be no upper bound on those .__c8
__s^no__i - i have a feeling that backchannels which are the vast majority of overlaps in switchboard uh don't play as big a role here because it's very unnatural i think to backchannel if - in a multi audience - you know in a multi person audience .__ca
__s__if you can see them actually .__c1
__s:s__it's interesting .__c1
__s:s__so if you watch people are going like right - right like this here .__c1
__s.%--:qw.%--__right .__ca
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__but - that may not be the case if you couldn't see them .__c1
__s__u- ==__c3
__s__but - but it's sort of odd if one person's speaking and everybody's listening .__ca
__b__and it's unusual to have everybody going uhhuh uhhuh .__ca
__b__actually i think i've done it a fair number of times today .__c3
__s__@reject@ but .__c3
__s^aa|s^na__yeah .__c1
__s__there's a lot of head nodding in this @reject@ .__c1
__b__um .__cb
__s^aa|s^na__yeah .__ca
__qw__yep we need to put trackers on it .__cb
__fh__in - in the two person ==__c0
__s^df^rt__yeah yeah yeah .__c4
__%-__he could he could .__c8
__s__plus - plus - plus the ==__ca
__s^df__yeah .__ca
__%-__so so - actually um that's in part because the nodding - if you have visual contact the nodding has the same function .__ca
__s^df^e.%--__but on the phone in switchboard you - you - that wouldn't work .__ca
__s^df__yeah you don't have it .__cb
__fh__so so you need to use the backchannel .__ca
__s__your mike is ==__cb
__s^bd__so in the two person conversations when there's backchannel is there a great deal of overlap in the speech ?__c0
__s__that is an earphone so if you just put it so it's on your ear .__cb
__s__or ?==__c0
__b__because my impression is sometimes it happens when there's a pause .__c0
__s^df__yes .__c1
__s^df^e.%--__there you go .__cb
__s^df^e__yeah .__c1
__s__thank you .__cb
__s__e- - for example .__c8
__s__you know like you - you get a lot of backchannel when somebody's pausing .__c0
__s^df^rt__yes .__c1
__s__right .__c1
__s^2__she's doing that .__c8
__b.%__sorry | what were you saying ?__c1
__s^aa__it's hard to do both .__c0
__s.%--:qw__huh ?__c0
__s^aa__um | no when - when - when there's backchannel i mean just - i was just listening and - and when there's two people talking and there's backchannel it seems like um the backchannel happens when you know the pitch drops and the first person ==__c0
__b__oh .__c1
__s^e:s__and a lot of times the first person actually stops talking and then there's a backchannel and then they start up again .__c0
__b__and so i'm wondering about - h- - i just wonder how much overlap there is .__c0
__s^e:s__is there a lot ?__c0
__s^e:s__i think there's a lot of the kind that jose was talking about where - i mean this is called precision timing in conversation analysis where they come in overlapping but at a point where the information is mostly complete .__c1
__s.%--__so all you're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words .__c1
__s__huh .__c0
__s^df__uhhuh .__c0
__s^e.%--__so technically it's an overlap .__c1
__b__but you know from information flow point of view it's not an overlap in the predictable information .__c1
__s.%--__but maybe a - just a small overlap ?__c0
__s__more yeah .__c4
__s^e.%--__it'd be interesting if we could do prediction .__cb
__s__i was just thinking more in terms of alignment alignment overlap .__c0
__s^df__yeah .__c1
__fh__language model prediction of overlap that would be really interesting .__cb
__s^df^e__so - so ==__ca
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^df^e__well that's exactly exactly why we wanted to study the precise timing of overlaps ins- - in uh switchboard .__c1
__%-__right .__ca
__s^cs__right .__cb
__s^bk__so - so here's a - here's a first interesting labeling task .__ca
__b__say because there's a lot of that .__c1
__s__uh | to distinguish between say backchannels precision timing - sort of you know benevolent overlaps and - and - and w- - and - and sort of um i don't know hostile overlaps where someone is trying to grab the floor from someone else .__ca
__s.%-__uhhuh .__cb
__s^e__let's pick a different word .__cb
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__s^df__uh that - that might be an interesting um problem to look at .__ca
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^na__hostile takeovers .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s^na^r|s^na__yeah .__c3
__qo.%--__well i mean you could do that .__c8
__s__yeah .__c4
__%-__i ju- - i - i think that in this meeting i really had the feeling that wasn't happening that the hostile - hostile type .__c8
__s__these were - these were benevolent types as people finishing each other's sentences and stuff .__c8
__s^aa__okay .__ca
__fh__uhhuh .__c1
__s__um | i could imagine that as - there's a fair number of um cases where and this is sort of not really hostile but sort of competitive where one person is finishing something and you have like two or three people jumping - trying to - trying to - trying to uh grab the next turn .__ca
__s__trying to get the floor .__cb
__qy^bh__yeah .__c3
__s^na__and so it's not against the person who talks first because actually we're all waiting for that person to finish .__ca
__s^aa|s^bd__but they all want to be next .__ca
__qy^d^g^rt__i have a feeling most of these things are - that - that are not a benevolent kind are - are are uh um are - are competitive as opposed to real- - really - really hostile .__c3
__s^aa__right .__ca
__s.%--__yeah i agree .__c8
__s.%--__but .__c3
__s__i wonder what determines who gets the floor ?__c0
__s__i agree .__c8
__s^na|s^2__well there are various things you you - have the ==__c8
__s__i mean ==__c0
__s^aa__uh | a vote - vote in florida .__c3
__s__it's been studied a lot .__cb
__b__yeah .__c3
__fg|s__voting for ==__c4
__s^2__um | o- - one thing - i - i wanted to - or you can tell a good joke and then everybody's laughing and you get a chance to g- - break in .__c3
__b__seniority .__ca
__b__but .__c3
__s^na__but .__c3
__s^e__um .__c3
__b__you know the other thing i was thinking was that um these - all these interesting questions are of course pretty hard to answer with uh u- - you know a small amount of data .__c3
__s^ng.%--__ach .__cb
__b__@reject@ so um i wonder if what you're saying suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have um a - a fair number of meetings with uh a smaller number of people .__c3
__qy__right ?__c3
__s__i mean we - most of our meetings are uh meetings currently with say five six seven eight people .__c3
__qw__should we really try to have some two person meetings or some three person meetings and re- - record them just to - to - to beef up the - the statistics on that ?__c3
__s__that's a control .__c8
__s__well it seems like there are two possibilities there .__c8
__s^bk__i mean i- - it seems like if you have just two people it's not really y- - like a meeting w- - is not as similar as the rest of the - of the sample .__c8
__b__it depends on what you're after of course .__c8
__s^cs__but it seems like that would be more a case of the control condition compared to uh an experimental condition with more than two .__c8
__s^ba__uhhuh .__cb
__s^df__well liz was raising the question of - of whether i- - it's the number - there's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there .__c3
__s^no__uhhuh .__c8
__fg|s__and um | if you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you'd still have the visuals .__c3
__s^r__you wouldn't have that difference also that you have in the say in switchboard data .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__s__uh .__c3
__s.%--__yeah i'm just thinking that'd be more like a c- - control condition .__c8
__s^cs__yeah .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__s^na__well but from the acoustic point of view it's all good .__cb
__s.%-__yeah .__c4
__s^aap|s^df^nd__is the same .__c4
__s^bd^no__yeah acoustic is fine .__c3
__s__if - if the goal were to just look at overlap you would - you could serve yourself - save yourself a lot of time but not even transcri- - transcribe the words .__ca
__s__but ==__c3
__%--__yep .__cb
__s__well i was thinking you should be able to do this from the acoustics on the close talking mikes .__c1
__s^aa|%-__well that's - the - that was my - my status report .__cb
__%-__yeah .__c3
__s__you've been working on that .__c8
__s__right ?__c1
__s__right | i mean adam was ==__c1
__s.%-__yeah .__c8
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^na__so once we're done with this stuff discussing .__cb
__s^aa__right .__c1
__s^ba__yeah .__c3
__s^e__i mean not as well as what - i mean you wouldn't be able to have any kind of typology obviously .__c1
__s^df^na__uhhuh .__cb
__b__but you'd get some rough statistics .__c1
__qh^df.%-__but - | what - what do you think about that ?__c3
__s^na__so ==__c1
__qh^df.%-__do you think that would be useful ?__c3
__b__i'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two person meetings or something .__c3
__s^ar|s__i guess my - my first comment was um only that um we should n- - not attribute overlaps only to meetings .__c1
__s^e__but maybe that's obvious .__c1
__b__maybe everybody knew that .__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__but that in normal conversation with two people there's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^df^nd__and that it would be interesting to look at whether there are these kinds of constraints that jane mentioned that what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn .__c1
__b.%__you know because now you can have five people trying to grab the turn .__c1
__b.%__but pretty quickly there're - they back off .__c1
__b__and you go back to this sort of only one person at a time with one person interrupting at a time .__c1
__%-__uhhuh .__c3
__s^df__so i don't know .__c1
__%-__to answer your question i it - i don't think it's crucial to have controls .__c1
__s^df__but i think it's worth recording all the meetings we can .__c1
__s^na__can .__cb
__s^df^e.%-__well okay .__c3
__s^cs.%-__yeah .__c4
__s^2__so um you know .__c1
__s^aa__i - i have an idea .__ca
__s^aa|s^na__d- - i wouldn't not record a two person meeting just because it only has two people .__c1
__s^na__right .__cb
__s^df__could we - could we um ?==__ca
__b__we have - have in the past and i think continue - will continue to have a fair number of uh phone conference calls .__ca
__s^df.%-__uhhuh .__c3
__s^df^e__yeah we talked about this repeatedly .__cb
__s^df:s__and uh | and as a - to um as another c- - c- - comparison condition we could um see what - what what happens in terms of overlap when you don't have visual contact .__ca
__fh__so um ==__ca
__s^df^e:s__can we actually record ?__c1
__fh__it just seems like that's a very different thing than what we're doing .__cb
__%-__uh | well we'll have to set up for it .__c3
__b__i mean physically can we record the o- - the other ?==__c1
__s^na__yeah .__c3
__s^df^e__well we're not really set up for it to do that .__c3
__%-__but ==__c3
__%-__or | this is getting a little extravagant we could put up some kind of blinds or something to - to remove uh visual contact .__ca
__fh__yeah .__c3
__%-__barriers !__cb
__%-__yeah .__c2
__s^e__that's what they did on map task you know this map task corpus .__c1
__s.%--__they ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without visual cues .__c1
__%-__and it's quite interesting .__c1
__s__well we - we record this meeting so regularly it wouldn't be that - i mean a little strange .__c3
__s^df__okay we can record but no one can look at each other .__cb
__s__well | we could just put b- - blindfolds on .__c1
__s^na__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__close your eyes .__cb
__s^na__well | y- - no you - f- ==__ca
__s__blindf- ==__c8
__s__yeah yeah .__ca
__s^bk__turn off the lights .__cb
__b__and we'd take a picture of everybody sitting here with blindfolds .__c1
__s__that would ==__c1
__b.%__oh | th- - that was the other thing .__c3
__s^e__weren't we going to take a picture at the beginning of each of these meetings ?__c3
__s^e__um | what - i had thought we were going to do is just take pictures of the whiteboards rather than take pictures of the meeting .__cb
__s__well linguistic ==__c8
__b.%__and uh ==__cb
__s__yeah .__c8
__b__yes .__c3
__s.%--__linguistic anthropologists would - would suggest it would be useful to also take a picture of the meeting .__c8
__b__there's a head nodding here vigorously yeah .__c3
__b__why - why do we want to have a picture of the meeting ?__c0
__s.%--__the - because you get then the spatial relationship of the speakers .__c8
__fh__ee- - you mean transc- - no ==__c1
__s__well you could do that by just noting on the enrollment sheet the - the seat number .__ca
__b__and that could be ==__c8
__s__@reject@ yeah yeah .__c4
__qy^d^g__yeah .__c4
__b__seat number that's a good idea .__cb
__fh__i'll do that .__cb
__s^df^ng__yeah .__c4
__s__i'll do that on the next set of forms .__cb
__s^aa__so you'd number them somehow .__ca
__s.%-__yeah .__c4
__s__is possible to get information from the rhythmic - f- - from the ge- - uh uh files .__c4
__s^e__i finally remembered to put uh put native language on the newer forms .__cb
__b__we can - can't you figure it out from the mike number ?__c0
__s^cs.%--__no .__cb
__s.%-__okay .__c0
__s^e__the wireless ones .__cb
__b__and even the jacks i mean i'm sitting here and the jack is over in front of you .__cb
__s__oh .__c0
__s__but probably from these you could've infer it .__c1
__s.%-__yeah but it's - it would be trivial ==__ca
__s^2__it would be another task .__cb
__b__it would be a research task .__c1
__s^aa|s__having - having ground tu- - truth would be nice so seat number would be good .__cb
__s^na__you know where you could get it ?__c0
__s^df.%-__yeah yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__beam forming during the digit uh stuff .__c0
__s__so i'm going to put little labels on all the chairs with the seat number .__cb
__s^df__uhhuh .__c2
__s^aa__that's a good idea .__cb
__fh__not the chairs .__ca
__s^aa__but you have to keep the chairs in the same pla- - like here .__c1
__b__but uh ==__cb
__fh__the chairs are - chairs are movable .__ca
__s^ba__put them - like put them on the table where they ==__ca
__b__the chair- - yeah .__c4
__s^df.%--__yep .__cb
__s__yeah .__c2
__b.%__yep .__cb
__s^bk__but you know they - the - s- - the linguistic anthropologists would say it would be good to have a digital picture anyway .__c8
__fh__just remembered a joke .__c0
__s__because you get a sense also of posture .__c8
__s__what people were wearing .__ca
__s^e__yeah .__cb
__s__posture and we could like you know block out the person's face or whatever .__c8
__b__the fashion statement .__c1
__s__but - but you know these are important cues .__c8
__s^df__oh andreas was ==__ca
__s^aa__how big their heads are .__c0
__s^na^rt__i mean the - the - how a person is sitting is ==__c8
__s__but if you just ==__c3
__s^df.%-__yeah .__ca
__s^df^e:s__f- - but from one picture i don't know that you really get that .__c3
__b__andreas was wearing that same old sweater again .__ca
__s^na__right ?__c3
__b__you'd want a video for that i think .__c3
__s^cs__it'd be better than nothing is - is - i- - just from a single picture i think you can tell some aspects .__c8
__fh__a video yeah .__c4
__s__think so ?__c3
__s__i mean i - i could tell you i mean if i- - if i'm in certain meetings i notice that there are certain people who really do - uh - the body language is very uh - is very interesting in terms of the dominance aspect .__c8
__s__and - and ==__ca
__b__huh .__c3
__%-__yeah .__ca
__s.%-__and - and morgan had that funny hair again .__ca
__s|s^aa__yeah well i mean you black out the - that part .__c8
__s^ba__huh .__cb
__s^df.%-__but it's just you know the - the body .__c8
__s^aa|s^na__he agreed .__c0
__s^e__you know ?__c8
__s^cs__of course the - where we sit at the table i find is very interesting that we do tend to cong- - to gravitate to the same place each time .__cb
__s.%--__yeah .__c8
__s.%-__and it's somewhat coincidental .__cb
__s^df^nd__i'm sitting here so that i can run into the room if the hardware starts you know catching fire or something .__cb
__s^df__oh no you - you just like to be in charge that's why you're sitting ==__ca
__s^df^e^rt__i just want to be at the head of the table .__cb
__s^ar|s.%-__yeah .__ca
__s^e__take control .__cb
__s^ar__speaking of taking control you said you had some research to talk about .__c3
__s^r__yeah .__c8
__s^nd__yeah i've been playing with um uh using the close talking mike to do - to try to figure out who's speaking .__cb
__%-__yeah .__c8
__b.%__so my first attempt was just using thresholding and filtering that we talked about - about two weeks ago .__cb
__s__and so i played with that a little bit and it works okay except that it's very sensitive to your choice of your filter width and your threshold .__cb
__b__so if you fiddle around with it a little bit and you get good numbers you can actually do a pretty good job of segmenting when someone's talking and when they're not .__cb
__b__but if you try to use the same parameters on another speaker it doesn't work anymore .__cb
__s.%--__even if you normalize it based on the absolute loudness .__cb
__s__but does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole meeting ?__c1
__s__it does work for the one speaker throughout the whole meeting .__cb
__qy^bu^d^rt^t3__um | pretty well .__cb
__s^e__pretty well .__cb
__qy^bu^d^e^rt^t3__how did you do it adam ?__c0
__b__how did i do it ?__cb
__s__what do you mean ?__cb
__s__yeah .__c0
__s^bk__i mean wh- - what was the ==__c0
__s__the algorithm was uh take o- - every frame that's over the threshold and then median filter it and then look for runs .__cb
__s^cs__yeah .__c0
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c0
__fh__so there was a minimum run length .__cb
__qrr.%--__every frame that's over what threshold ?__c0
__s^aa^rt__so that ==__cb
__s.%-__a threshold that you pick .__cb
__qrr__in terms of energy ?__c0
__s__yeah .__cb
__fh__uh .__c0
__b__okay .__c0
__s.%--__say that again .__c8
__s^no__frame over fres- - threshold .__c8
__s^cs__so you take a - each frame and you compute the energy .__cb
__s__and if it's over the threshold you set it to one and if it's under the threshold you set it to zero so now you have a bit stream of zeros and ones .__cb
__s__huh .__c8
__b__okay .__c8
__b__and then i median filtered that using um a fairly long filter length .__cb
__%-__uh | well actually i guess depends on what you mean by long you know tenth of a second sorts of numbers .__cb
__s__um | and that's to average out you know pitch you know the pitch contours and things like that .__cb
__s^df__and then uh looked for long runs .__cb
__%-__okay .__c8
__s.%--__and that works okay if you fil- - if you tune the filter parameters if you tune how long your median filter is and how high you're looking for your thresholds .__cb
__s__did you ever try running the filter before you pick a threshold ?__c0
__s^bk__no .__cb
__s^rt__i certainly could though .__cb
__s__but this was just i had the program mostly written already so it was easy to do .__cb
__s__okay and then the other thing i did was i took javier's speaker change detector - acoustic change detector and i implemented that with the close talking mikes .__cb
__b__and unfortunately that's not working real well and it looks like it's ==__cb
__s__the problem is - he does it in two passes .__cb
__s__the first pass is to find candidate places to do a break .__cb
__s__and he does that using a neural net doing broad phone classification and he has the the uh one of the phone classes is silence .__cb
__b__and so the possible breaks are where silence starts and ends .__cb
__fh__and then he has a second pass which is a modeling - a gaussian mixture model .__cb
__s__um | looking for uh whether it improves or - or degrades to split at one of those particular places .__cb
__%-__and what looks like it's happening is that the - even on the close talking mike the broad phone class classifier's doing a really bad job .__cb
__s__who was it trained on ?__c0
__s^df__uh | i have no idea .__cb
__s^cs__i don't remember .__cb
__s^cs__huh .__c0
__s^cs^e__does an- - do you remember morgan ?__cb
__s^2__was it broadcast news ?__cb
__b.%__i think so yeah .__c3
__s^cs__um | so at any rate my next attempt which i'm in the midst of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the uh thresholding as the way of generating the candidates .__cb
__b.%__because one of the things that definitely happens is if you put the threshold low you get lots of breaks .__cb
__fh__all of which are definitely acoustic events .__cb
__%-__they're definitely someone talking .__cb
__s^cs__but like it could be someone who isn't the person here but the person over there or it can be the person breathing .__cb
__s^df__and then feeding that into the acoustic change detector .__cb
__s^aa__and so i think that might work .__cb
__b__but i haven't gotten very far on that .__cb
__s^df__but all of this is close talking mike .__cb
__%-__so ==__cb
__s^na__it's uh just - just trying to get some ground truth .__cb
__s__only with uh uh ==__c4
__s__but uh i - i - i think uh when - when y- - i - i saw the - the - the - the speech from p d a and uh close talker .__c4
__%-__i - i think the there is a - a great difference in the - in the signal .__c4
__s^nd.%--__oh absolutely .__cb
__s|qy^d^f^g__so s- - my intention for this is - is as an aide for ground truth .__cb
__s^bd^no__um | but uh i - but uh i - i - i mean that uh uh in the - in the mixed file you can find uh zone with uh great different uh level of energy .__c4
__b__not ==__cb
__s^df.%-__um | i - i think for uh algorithm based on energy uh that um h- - huh - more or less uh like uh uh huh first sound energy detector .__c4
__s__say it again ?__cb
__qy^d^f^g__uh nnn .__c4
__%-__when y- - you the detect the - the - the first at - at the end of - of the detector of um princ- - um .__c4
__s^e__what is the - the name in english ?__c4
__qw__the - the huh the de- - detector of um of a word in the - in the s- - in - an isolated word in - in the background that uh ==__c4
__s__i'm - i'm not sure what you're saying .__cb
__s^na__can you try ?==__cb
__s__i mean that when - when you use uh uh any ==__c4
__s^aa|s__i think he's saying the onset detector .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__b__onset detector okay .__cb
__%-__i - i think it's probably to work well uh because uh you have uh in the mixed files a great level of energy .__c4
__s__uh and great difference between the sp- - speaker .__c4
__s__and probably is not so easy when you use the - the p d a uh that - because the signal is uh the - in the e- - energy level .__c4
__s__right .__cb
__s^bd^df__in - in that uh uh speech file is uh more similar .__c4
__b__right .__cb
__s.%--__between the different uh speaker um i - i think is - uh it will i- - is my opinion .__c4
__s__but different speakers .__cb
__fh__it will be uh more difficult to - to detect bass tone energy .__c4
__s^na.%__the - the change .__c4
__s^rt__i think that um ==__c4
__s^df__uh in the clo- - in the p d a you mean ?__cb
__fg__in the p d a .__c4
__fh__absolutely .__cb
__s^t^tc__yeah no question .__cb
__s^bu^rt__yeah .__c4
__s^e__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__it'll be much harder .__cb
__fh__much harder .__cb
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s^ba__and the - the another question that when i review the - the - the work of javier .__c4
__s^t__i think the nnn - the nnn - that the idea of using a neural network to - to get a broad class of phonetic uh from uh uh a candidate from the - the - the speech signal .__c4
__s^ba^t1.%__if you have uh uh i'm considering only because javier uh only consider uh like candidate the nnn uh the silence because it is the - the only model uh - uh he used that uh uh nnn to detect the - the possibility of a - a change between the - between the speaker .__c4
__s__right .__cb
__s__um | another - another research thing different groups uh working uh on broadcast news prefer to uh to consider hypothesis uh between each phoneme .__c4
__qy^d^g__uhhuh .__cb
__s__yeah when a phone changes .__cb
__qh__because i - i - i think it's more realistic that uh only consider the - the the - the silence between the speaker .__c4
__s__uh there - there exists uh silence between - between uh a speaker .__c4
__s^bk__is - is uh uh acoustic uh event important to - to consider .__c4
__s.x__uhhuh .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s__i - i found that the uh silence in - in many occasions in the - in the speech file .__c4
__fh|s^df.%--__but uh when you have uh uh two speakers together without enough silence between - between them uh i think uh is better to use the acoustic change detector basically and i - i - i i x or huh bic criterion for consider all the frames in my opinion .__c4
__%--__uhhuh .__c3
__s^no__yeah | the - you know the reason that he uh just used silence was not because he thought it was better it was - it was - it was the place he was starting .__c3
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__s__yep .__cb
__%-__yeah .__c4
__s^bd^df^rt__so he was trying to get something going .__c3
__s^cs__yeah yeah yeah yeah .__c4
__s__and uh e- - e- - you know as - as - as is in your case if you're here for only a modest number of months you try to pick a realistic goal .__c3
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__do something .__cb
__s__yeah yeah yeah yeah .__c4
__b__but his - his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s^2__but uh | do - do you think that if you consider all the frames to apply the - the uh the bic criterion to detect the - the - the different acoustic change uh between speaker ?__c4
__s^df.%--__without uh with uh silence or with overlapping .__c4
__s^bk__uh ==__c4
__s^cs__i think like - like uh uh a general uh uh way of process the - the acoustic change .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__b__in a first step i mean .__c4
__%-__uhhuh .__c3
__b__an- - and then uh uh without considering the you - you - you um you can consider the energy like a- - another parameter in the - in the feature vector .__c4
__s__right .__cb
__s^e__absolutely .__cb
__s^bk__uh ==__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^aa|s^cs__this - this is the idea .__c4
__s^na__and if if you do that uh uh with a bic uh criterion for example or with another kind of uh of distance in a first step and then you uh you get the uh the hypothesis to the - this change acoustic uh to po- - process .__c4
__s__right .__cb
__s^aa|s^no__because uh uh probably you - you can find the - the uh a small gap of silence between speaker with uh uh a ga- - huh small duration less than uh two hundred milliseconds for example .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__and apply another - another algorithm another approach like uh uh detector of ene- - uh detector of bass tone energy to - to consider that uh that uh zone of s- - a small silence between speaker .__c4
__s__or another algorithm to - to process uh the - the segment between marks uh founded by the - the the bic criterion and applied for - for each frame .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__b__i think is uh nnn it will be a- - an - an - a more general approach the if we compare - with use uh a neural net or another uh speech recognizer with a broad class or - or narrow class .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk__because in my opinion uh it's in my opinion uh if you - if you change the condition of the speech i mean if you adjust to your algorithm with a mixed speech file and to uh to uh adapt the neural net uh used by javier with a mixed file .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^e__uhhuh .__c3
__s^aa|s^na__with the what file ?__cb
__s^e__uh with a m- - mixed file .__c4
__qy^d^g__with a - the mix mix .__c4
__s^aa__mixed .__c8
__s^cs__mixed .__c0
__s^aa|s^na__mixed ?__cb
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk__sorry .__c4
__%-__and and then you - you uh you try to - to apply that uh uh uh speech recognizer to that signal to the p d a uh speech file i - i think you will have problems because the - the - the - the condition you - you will need t- - t- - i - i suppose that you will need to - to - to retrain it .__c4
__s^bk__oh absolutely .__cb
__s^bk__well | i - i ==__c3
__s^ba__this is - this is not what i was suggesting to do .__cb
__s^e__u- - look | i - i think this is a ==__c3
__s^ba^na__really ?__c4
__s.%-__one - once - it's a - i used to work like on voiced - on voice silence detection you know and this is this kind of thing .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s.%-__um if you have somebody who has some experience with this sort of thing and they work on it for a couple months they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily .__c3
__s^aa__then you say okay i don't just want to get most of the cases i want it to be really accurate .__c3
__s^cs__then it gets really hard no matter what you do .__c3
__s^j:s^cs__so the p- - the problem is is that if you say well i - i have these other data over here that i learn things from either explicit training of neural nets or of gaussian mixture models or whatever .__c3
__fg|s^t^tc__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__uh | suppose you don't use any of those things .__c3
__s^aa|s^na__you say you have looked for acoustic change .__c3
__s^bk__well what does that mean ?__c3
__s^bk.%__that - that means you set some thresholds somewhere or something .__c3
__s^t^tc.%--__yeah .__c4
__s__right ?__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^cs:qy__and - and so where do you get your thresholds from ?__c3
__b__from something that you looked at .__c3
__s^bk|s^ba__so | you always have this problem you're going to new data .__c3
__s^na__um | h- - how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data uh if it's going to be different from old data that you have ?__c3
__b__and i think that's a problem with this .__c3
__b__well | also what i'm doing right now is not intended to be an acoustic change detector for far field mikes .__cb
__%-__what i'm doing is trying to use the close talking mike and just use - can- - and just generate candidate and just try to get a first pass at something that sort of works .__cb
__fg|s__yeah .__c4
__s__actually - actually - actually ==__ca
__s.%--__you have candidates .__c0
__b__the candidate .__c4
__s__i ==__ca
__s^ba__to make marking easier .__c0
__fh__or ==__ca
__s__yeah .__c0
__s^e__and i haven't spent a lot of time on it and i'm not intending to spend a lot of time on it .__cb
__qw^rt__okay .__ca
__s^bk|s.%-__i - um i unfortunately have to run .__ca
__s__so ==__cb
__b__but um i can imagine uh building a um model of speaker change detection that takes into account both the far field and the uh actually not just the close talking mike for that speaker but actually for all of th- - for all of the speakers .__ca
__s__yep .__cb
__b__everyone else .__cb
__s^2__yeah .__c3
__s^e__um | if you model the - the effect that me speaking has on your microphone and everybody else's microphone as well as on that and you build um ==__ca
__s^aa__basically i think you'd - you would build a - an h m m that has as a state space all of the possible speaker combinations .__ca
__s^aa__all the - | yep .__cb
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s^cs__and um | you can control ==__ca
__s^ba__it's a little big .__cb
__s^aa__it's not that big actually .__ca
__s^aa__um .__ca
__s__two to the n .__cb
__s^ba__two to the number of people in the meeting .__cb
__s^cs^j__but - | actually andreas may- - maybe - maybe just something simpler but - but along the lines of what you're saying .__c3
__s^ba__anyway .__cb
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s^2^bu^d^rt__i was just realizing i used to know this guy who used to build uh um mike mixers - automatic mike mixers where you know t- - in order to able to turn up the gain you know uh as much as you can you - you - you lower the gain on - on the mikes of people who aren't talking .__c3
__s__huh .__ca
__s^j^na__yeah yeah .__c4
__s^ba__huh .__ca
__qy.%-__uhhuh .__ca
__s__right ?__c3
__b.%__uhhuh .__ca
__b.%__and then he had some sort of reasonable way of doing that .__c3
__s__but uh what if you were just looking at very simple measures like energy measures but you don't just compare it to some threshold overall but you compare it to the energy in the other microphones ?__c3
__s^aa__i was thinking about doing that originally to find out who's the loudest .__cb
__s^bk__and that person is certainly talking .__cb
__s^ba__yeah .__c3
__b__but i also wanted to find threshold - uh excuse me mol- - overlap .__cb
__b.%__yeah .__c3
__b.%__so not just - just the loudest .__cb
__b__uhhuh .__c8
__%-__but uh ==__c4
__s__i - i sorry .__c4
__%--__i - i have found that when - when i i analyzed the - the speech files from the uh mike uh from the uh close uh microphone uh i found zones with a - a different level of energy .__c4
__fg|s__sorry i have to go .__ca
__b__okay .__cb
__s^df__could you fill that out anyway ?__cb
__s^2.%-__just put your name in .__cb
__s^aa__are y- - you want me to do it ?__cb
__%__i'll do it .__cb
__fh__but he's not going to even read that .__c0
__b__i know .__cb
__s__oh .__c0
__s.%-__including overlap zone .__c4
__qy^cs^rt__including .__c4
__s__because uh uh depend on the position of the - of the microph- - of the each speaker to uh to get more o- - or less energy i- - in the mixed sign- - in the signal .__c4
__b__and then if you consider energy to - to detect overlapping in - in uh and you process the - the - in - the - the - the speech file from the - the - the mixed signals .__c4
__s__the mixed signals uh .__c4
__s__i - i think it's - it's difficult um only to en- - with energy to - to consider that in that zone we have uh uh overlapping zone uh if you process only the the energy of the of each frame .__c4
__s__well it's probably harder .__c3
__b__but i - i think what i was s- - nnn noting just when he - when andreas raised that was that there's other information to be gained from looking at all of the microphones and you may not need to look at very sophisticated things .__c3
__fg|s__yeah .__c4
__s^df__because if there's - if most of the overlaps - you know this doesn't cover say three but if most of the overlaps say are two if the distribution looks like there's a couple high ones and - and the rest of them are low .__c3
__s^cs__yeah .__c4
__s^df__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s^aa|s__and everyone else is low yeah .__cb
__s^bd^no__yeah .__c4
__s^2.%-__you know what i mean ?__c3
__b__yeah .__c4
__s.%--__there's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures .__c3
__s^df__yeah .__c4
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^e__uh by the way i had an idea with - while i was watching chuck nodding at a lot of these things is that we can all wear little bells on our heads so that then you'd know that .__c3
__s^e__yeah .__c4
__%-__ding ding ding ding .__cb
__fg|s^na:s__ding .__c8
__s^na:s__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__that's cute .__c8
__s__i think that'd be really interesting too with blindfolds .__c1
__b__nodding with blindfolds .__cb
__%-__then ==__c1
__s^bd.%--__yeah .__c1
__s.%-__what are you nodding about ?__cb
__s__the question is like whether ==__c1
__b__well trying with and - with and without yeah .__c1
__s__sorry i'm just - i'm just going to sleep .__cb
__s^e__but then there's just one @reject@ like .__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__qh^cs__actually i saw a uh - a woman at the bus stop the other day who um was talking on her cell phone speaking japanese and was bowing .__c0
__b__yeah yeah .__c4
__s^df__you know profusely .__c0
__s^df^e.%--__oh yeah that's really common .__c1
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__s^e__uh .__c8
__s^ba^na__just kept ==__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__b__wow .__c3
__s^e__it's very difficult if you try - while you're trying say to convince somebody on the phone it's difficult not to move your hands .__c1
__s^df__not - you know if you watch people they'll actually do these things .__c1
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c3
__%--__so ==__c1
__s^t^tc__i still think we should try a - a meeting or two with the blindfolds .__c1
__s^t3__at least of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of .__c1
__s.%-__uhhuh .__cb
__%-__yeah i think th- ==__c3
__qy^rt__um maybe for part of the meeting we don't have to do it the whole meeting .__c1
__fh__i think it's a great idea .__c3
__s.%-__that could be fun .__c1
__s__it'll be too hard to make barriers i was thinking because they have to go all the way .__c1
__s^2__w- - yeah .__c3
__s^no.%__you know i can see chuck even if you put a barrier here .__c1
__b__well | we could just turn out the lights .__cb
__s^aa|%-__actually well also - | i - i can say i made barr- - barriers for - so that - the stuff i was doing with collin wha- - which just used um this kind of foam board .__c8
__b__y- - yeah ?__c1
__s__r- - really inexpensive .__c8
__s^ba__you can - you can masking tape it together .__c8
__b__these are you know pretty l- - large partitions .__c8
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^ba__but then we also have these mikes is the other thing i was thinking .__c1
__s^bk__so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb the sound .__c1
__s^aa__the acoustics .__cb
__s^aa__it's true it would disturb the um the - the long range .__c8
__s^ba__um ==__c1
__s__blindfolds would be good .__c3
__s^ba__i think blindfolds .__cb
__s^j__it would ==__c8
__s^aa|s^na__i mean it sounds weird but - but - you know it's - it's cheap and uh be interesting to have the camera going .__c1
__s:s__probably we should wait until after adam's set up the mikes .__c3
__s^bk__but ==__c3
__fg__okay .__c8
__s__i think we're going to have to work on the uh - on the human subjects form .__c8
__s:qw__i'll be peeking .__c0
__s^bk__yeah that's right we didn't tell them we would be blindfolding .__cb
__qy^bu^d^rt^t__that's ==__c3
__s__do you mind being blindfolded while you're interviewed ?__c8
__qy^e.%-__that's - that's - that's the one that we videotape .__c3
__s^aa__so ==__c3
__s__um | i - i want to move this along .__c3
__s.%-__uh | i did have this other agenda item which is uh @reject@ - it's uh a list which i sent to uh - a couple folks but um i wanted to get broader input on it .__c3
__qy__so this is the things that i think we did in the last three months .__c3
__s__obviously not everything we did but - but sort of highlights that i can - can tell s- - some outside person you know what - what were you actually working on .__c3
__b__um | in no particular order uh one uh ten more hours of meeting r- - meetings recorded something like that you know from - from uh three months ago .__c3
__s^bd__uh | x m l formats and other transcription aspects sorted out and uh sent to i b m .__c3
__fh__um | pilot data put together and sent to i b m for transcription .__c3
__%-__uh | next batch of recorded data put together on the c d roms for shipment to i b m .__c3
__s^t3__hasn't been sent yet but - it's getting ready .__cb
__s^t3__but yeah that's why i phrased it that way yeah okay .__c3
__b__um | human subjects approval on campus uh and release forms worked out .__c3
__qy__so the meeting participants have a chance to request audio pixelization of selected parts of the spee- - their speech .__c3
__s__um | audio pixelization software written and tested .__c3
__s^bk__um | preliminary analysis of overlaps in the pilot data we have transcribed .__c3
__s.%--__and exploratory analysis of long distance inferences for topic coherence that was - i was - wasn't sure if those were the right way - that was the right way to describe that because of that little exercise that - that you and - and lokendra did .__c3
__s^t3__what was that called ?__c8
__qw^d^rt__the uh say again .__c8
__s__i - well i- - i'm probably saying this wrong but what i said was exploratory analysis of long distance inferences for topic coherence .__c3
__qy^rt__something like that .__c3
__h|qw__um so uh | i - a lot of that was from you know what - what - what you two were doing .__c3
__s__so i - i sent it to you .__c3
__s^t1__and you know please mail me you know the corrections or suggestions for changing .__c3
__s.%--__uhhuh .__cb
__s.%-__i - i don't want to make this twice it's length but - but you know just im- - improve it .__c3
__s^ar|s^nd__um | is there anything anybody ==__c3
__s^bk|s__i - i did a bunch of stuff for supporting of digits .__cb
__s^aa__bunch of stuff for s- ==__c3
__s^bk__okay maybe - maybe send me a sentence that's a little thought through about that .__c3
__s__so okay i'll send you a sentence that doesn't just say a bunch of ?__cb
__s^no__bunch of stuff yeah stuff is probably bad too .__c3
__fh|s^co.%--__yep .__cb
__s^bk__stuff is not very technical .__cb
__s__yeah well .__c3
__s__i'll try to phrase it in passive voice .__cb
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__s^bsc__yeah yeah .__c3
__s^cs__technical stuff .__c0
__s^cs^e__range of things yeah .__c3
__fh__um | and - and you know i sort of threw in what you did with what jane did on - in - under the uh uh preliminary analysis of overlaps .__c3
__qw__uh uh | thilo can you tell us about all the work you've done on this project in the last uh last three months ?__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__fh__so - what is - what - um ?==__c2
__s__that's ==__c3
__h|qw__not really .__c2
__s.%-__it's too complicated .__c0
__h|s__um | i didn't get it .__c2
__s^aap|s^aa__wh- - what is audio pixelization ?__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__uh | audio pix- - wh- - he did it .__c3
__s^bu^e__so why don't you explain it quickly ?__c3
__s__it's just uh beeping out parts that you don't want included in the meeting .__cb
__s^bk__so you know you can say things like well this should probably not be on the record but beep .__cb
__s^aa__okay okay .__c2
__qw^br__i got that .__c2
__s.%-__yeah .__c3
__s^t3__we - we - we spent a - a - a fair amount of time early on just talk- - dealing with this issue about op w- - e- - e- - we realized well people are speaking in an impromptu way and they might say something that would embarrass them or others later and how do you get around that .__c3
__s__@reject@ .__c2
__s^2.%--__okay .__c2
__s^aa__so in the consent form it says well you - we will look at the transcripts later and if there's something that you're unhappy with yeah .__c3
__s^aa__okay and you can say ==__c2
__fh__okay .__c2
__s^e^t3__but you don't want to just totally excise it .__c3
__fh__because ==__c3
__qh^cs__um ==__c3
__s^bk|s__uh well you have to be careful about excising it how - how you excise it .__c3
__%-__keeping the timing right and so forth .__c3
__qy^rt__so that at the moment tho- - th- - the idea we're running with is - is h- - putting the beep over it .__c3
__s^bd__yeah you can either beep or it can be silence .__cb
__%-__okay .__c2
__s^bk^t3__i - i couldn't decide which was the right way to do it .__cb
__s^ft^t3|s^t3__uh yeah .__c4
__s__beep is good auditorily .__cb
__s__if someone is listening to it there's no mistake that it's been beeped out .__cb
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__s^t^tc__but for software it's probably better for it to be silence .__cb
__s__no no .__c0
__s__you can - you know you could make a m- - as long as you keep using the same beep people could make a model of that beep .__c0
__s__huh .__c8
__s__yep .__cb
__s__and ==__c0
__s__i like that idea .__c8
__fg|s^arp__and i use - it's - it's uh it's an a below middle c beep .__cb
__s^aap__i think the beep is a really good idea .__c1
__s__it's very clear .__c8
__s.%--__yeah .__c0
__qy^d^f^g__then you don't think it's a long pause .__c8
__s.%-__also ==__c1
__s^nd__so ==__cb
__s__yeah it's more obvious that there was something there than if there's just silence .__c0
__s^cs__yeah | that - i mean he's - he's removing the old thing .__c3
__b__yeah .__c8
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s^am__yeah .__c4
__s^no__yep .__cb
__s.%-__and - and - and ==__c3
__qy^d^g__yea- - right .__c0
__s^bk__right .__c0
__s.%--__yeah it's not ==__cb
__qw.%--__but i mean if you just replaced it with silence it's not clear whether that's really silence or ==__c0
__%-__yeah .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^2__yeah i agree .__c8
__s__yep .__cb
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__b.%__yeah .__c3
__b__one - one question .__c8
__b__do you do it on all channels ?__c8
__s__of course .__cb
__s^e__interesting .__c8
__s^bk__i like that .__c8
__s^cs__yeah you have to do it on all channels because it's uh audible .__cb
__%--__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah i like that .__c8
__s^aa|s^na__very clear .__c8
__s^cs__very clear .__c8
__%-__uh it's - it's potentially audible you could potentially recover it .__cb
__s^cs^e:qw__ke- - keep a back door .__c3
__s^df__well the other thing that - you know i mean the - the alternative might be to s- ==__c8
__s^ba__yeah .__cb
__s^df__well i - i haven't thrown away any of the meetings that i beeped .__cb
__s__actually yours is the only one that i beeped and then uh the ar- - darpa meeting .__cb
__s^j__notice how quiet i am .__c1
__s^j^na__sorry .__cb
__s^na__and then the darpa meeting i just excised completely .__cb
__s^df^na__yeah .__c8
__s^m.%--__so it's in a private directory .__cb
__s^aa|s^na__that's great .__c8
__b__you have some people who only have beeps as their speech in these meetings .__c1
__s^df__yeah .__c8
__s^t3__okay .__c3
__%-__they're easy to find then .__c0
__s^aa^t3__all right so uh i think we should uh uh go on to the digits .__c3
__s^t3__okay .__cb
__s__i have one concept a- - t- - i - i want to say which is that i think it's nice that you're preserving the time relations .__c8
__qh__s- - so you're - you're not just cutting - you're not doing scissor snips .__c8
__s__right .__cb
__s^t3__you're - you're keeping the uh the time duration of a - de- - deleted - deleted part .__c8
__s^t3__yeah definitely .__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__s.%--__okay good | digits .__c8
__s^f__yeah since we want to possibly synchronize these things as well .__cb
__s__oh i should have done that .__cb
__b__shoot !__cb
__s^e__it's great .__c8
__s^aa|s^ba^na__oh well .__cb
__s^df^e__yeah .__c3
__s__oh ==__c3
__qr__so i guess if there's an overlap like if i'm saying something that's bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped too ?__c1
__s__you'll lose it .__cb
__s^cs__there's no way around that .__cb
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s^df|qy^d^f^g__um | i d- - i did - before we do the digits i did also want to remind people uh please do send me you know uh thoughts for an agenda .__c3
__%-__agenda ?__cb
__s^aa|s__yeah .__c3
__fh__that - that would be that'd be good .__c3
__s^cs.%--__good .__c8
__s^bd__uh so that uh people's ideas don't get ==__c3
__s^cs__thursday crept up on me this week .__cb
__s^aa__yeah well it does creep up .__c3
__s__doesn't it ?__c3
__s__okay .__c3
__s^aa__and i wanted to say i think this is really interesting analysis .__c1
__s:qw__it's cool stuff definitely .__cb
__b__thank you .__c8
__b.%__thank you .__c8
__b.%__i meant to say that before i started off on the switchboard stuff .__c1
__s^e__i was going to say can you do that for the other meetings .__cb
__s^na.%--__it's neat .__c1
__s__can you do it for them ?__cb
__s__and no actually you can't .__cb
__s^no.%-__yeah .__c1
__s^ba__does it take ?==__c1
__s^ng__actually - actually i - i thought that's what you were giving us was another meeting and i was like oh okay .__c0
__fg|s__thank you .__c8
__s:s^aa|s^na__ooo cool !__cb
__s^2:s__yeah .__c8
__s^aa__aw thanks .__c8
__s|qy^d^g__how long does it take just briefly like t- - to - okay - to label the ?==__c1
__s^ba__no .__c8
__fh__i have the script now .__c8
__%-__so i mean it can work off the uh other thing .__c8
__s:s__it's - as soon as we get labels yep .__cb
__%-__okay .__c1
__s^e:s__but it has to be hand labeled first ?__c0
__s__but ==__c8
__s^e__uh well | yeah .__c8
__s^e__because uh well i mean once his - his algorithm is up and running then we can do it that way .__c8
__s__if it works well enough .__cb
__%--__right now it's not - not quite to the point where it works .__cb
__s__okay .__c1
__b__but i - i just worked off of my ==__c8
__s__okay go ahead ==__c3
__s__it's really neat .__c1
__b__thanks .__c8
__s^bk__appreciate that .__c8
__s^e.%--__i think - what i what - this has uh caused me - so this discussion caused me to want to subdivide these further .__c8
__s__i'm going to take a look at the uh backchannels .__c8
__s^bk__how much we have anal- - i hope to have that for next time .__c8
__b__yeah my - my algorithm worked great actually on these .__cb
__fh|s__that'd be interesting .__c0
__s.%--__but when you wear it like that or with the uh lapel or if you have it very far from your face that's when it starts failing .__cb
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c0
__s:s__well i can wear it i mean if you ==__c1
__s^e:s__oh .__c0
__b__it doesn't matter .__cb
__s^e:qw__okay .__c1
__fg|s.%-:s.%-__i mean we want it to work .__cb
__%-__right ?__cb
__b__it's too late now .__c0
__s^aa__i - i don't want to change the way we do the meeting .__cb
__b__i feel like this troublemaker .__c1
__s__it's uh - so it was just a comment on the software not a comment on prescriptions on how you wear microphones .__cb
__s__okay .__c1
__s__okay that's - let's - let's - let's do digits .__c3
__s^no__get the bolts whh whh .__cb
__s^na__let's do it .__c8
__%-__okay .__cb
__b__okay .__c8
__s__DIGIT_TASK__cb
__s:s__DIGIT_TASK__c0
__b__DIGIT_TASK__c1
__s^e:s__i'm sorry .__c1
__b__DIGIT_TASK__c1
__b__DIGIT_TASK__c3
__s__DIGIT_TASK__c2
__s__DIGIT_TASK__c4
__s^df__DIGIT_TASK__c8
__s^df^e__okay thank you .__cb
__b.%__do you want us to put a mark on the bottom of these when they've actually been read or ==__c8
__s^bk|s.%--__do you just ==__c8
__s__i- ==__c8
__s__the only one that wasn't read is ==__c8
__s^df__is known so we don't do it .__c8
__s__okay .__c8
