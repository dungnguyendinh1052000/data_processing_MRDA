__z__starts ==__c2
__z__no .__c2
__z__no .__c3
__z__no .__c2
__z__that's a different thing .__c3
__z__there's another ==__c2
__z__i don't know .__c2
__fg__it starts with a p or something .__c2
__s^bk__i forget the word for it but it's - it's um ==__c2
__qw__oh .__c3
__fh__typically when you - you're ab- - r- - starting around forty for most people .__c2
__s__it starts to harden and then it's just harder for the lens to shift things .__c2
__fh__oh .__c3
__%--__and th- - the - the symptom is typically that you - you have to hold stuff uh uh further away to - to see it .__c2
__qo^rt__uhhuh .__c4
__s^cs__yeah .__c4
__qy^rt__in fact uh m- - my brother's a gerontological psychologist .__c2
__s^aa__and he - he uh came up with an - an uh - a uh body age test which uh gets down to sort of only three measurements that are good enough st- - statistical predictors of all the rest of it .__c2
__s^aa__and one of them is - is the distance that you have to hold it at .__c2
__b__give someone a piece of paper and then they - oh .__c3
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__qy^d^rt__we're - we're live by the way so we've got a good intro here .__c0
__s__oh yeah .__c2
__b__about how old i am .__c2
__b__okay .__c2
__s__yep .__c0
__s.%--__we can edit that out if you want .__c0
__s__oh that's optional .__c3
__s__no that's okay .__c2
__fh__uhhuh .__c4
__fg|s__okay .__c0
__s__you know ?__c3
__s__so this time the form discussion should be very short .__c0
__s^bk|s__right ?__c0
__s__it also should be later .__c2
__s.%-__okay .__c0
__s__because jane uh is not here yet .__c2
__s__good point .__c0
__s^cc__and uh she'll be most interested in that .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__uh | she's probably least involved in the signal processing stuff .__c2
__s^na^rt__so maybe we can just - just uh ==__c2
__s__i don't think we should go though an elaborate thing .__c2
__s^no__but um uh jose and i were just talking about the uh uh speech e- - energy thing .__c2
__s^cs__the two last ==__c4
__qw^rt__yeah .__c4
__s^bd^rt|s^aa^rt__and i uh ==__c2
__s__we didn't talk about the derivatives .__c2
__s^bk__but i think you know the - the - i- ==__c2
__b.%__if i can - if you don't mind my - my speaking for you for a bit um uh ==__c2
__s^cc^rt__right now that he's not really showing any kind of uh distinction but uh ==__c2
__qw^rt__but we discussed a couple of the possible things that uh he can look at .__c2
__s.%-__um | and uh one is that uh this is all in log energy .__c2
__fh|s^rt__and log energy is basically compressing the distances uh between things .__c2
__b.%__um another is that he needs to play with the - the different uh uh temporal sizes .__c2
__s__he was - he - he was taking everything over two hundred milliseconds .__c2
__fh|s__uh | and uh he's going to vary that number and also look at moving windows as we discussed before .__c2
__s__um | and uh - and the other thing is that the - yeah doing the - subtracting off the mean and the variance in the - uh and dividing it by the standard deviation in the log domain may not be the right thing to do .__c2
__s^aa.%__hi .__c4
__qy^d^f^g^rt__hi jane .__c0
__s^rt^t__yeah .__c4
__fh__we just started .__c0
__qo^t__could you take that mike there ?__c0
__s__are these the long term means ?__c3
__s__like over the whole ==__c3
__fh__i mean the means of what ?__c3
__s^bk__uh b- - between - between ==__c2
__%-__all the frames in the conversation ?__c3
__s.%--__thanks .__c0
__s__or of things that ?==__c3
__s__no .__c2
__fg__between ==__c2
__s__neither .__c2
__s^cs^na__no .__c4
__s^aa__it's uh between the pauses uh for some segment .__c2
__fh__oh .__c3
__qy^rt__and so i- - i- - his - his - he's making the constraint it has to be at least two hundred milliseconds .__c2
__s^bk|s__oh .__c3
__s__and so you take that .__c2
__s^bk__and then he's - he's uh measuring at the frame level .__c2
__s^t__still at the frame level of what ==__c2
__s__right .__c3
__s^t__and then - and then just uh normalizing with that larger amount .__c2
__s__um and - but one thing he was pointing out is when he - he looked at a bunch of examples in log domain it is actually pretty hard to see the change .__c2
__s__and you can sort of see that because of j- - of just putting it on the board that if you sort of have log x plus log x that's the log of x plus the log of two .__c2
__s^bs__yep .__c4
__s^m^na__yeah | maybe it's not log distributed .__c3
__s^aa__huh .__c4
__s^bk^rt__yeah .__c4
__s^cs__and it's just you know it - it diminishes the effect of having two of them .__c2
__fh__@reject@ .__c4
__s__but you could do like a c d f there instead ?__c3
__b__um ==__c2
__fh__i mean we don't know that the distribution here is normally ==__c3
__fg|s__yes right .__c2
__s__so - so what i was suggesting to him is that ==__c2
__s^bu__so just some kind of a simple ==__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__actually a p d f .__c2
__qy^rt__but you know uh but either way .__c2
__h__p d f .__c3
__s^aa|%--__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c3
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__s.%--__yeah eith- - eith- - uh b- ==__c2
__h|s.%--__something like that where it's sort of data driven .__c3
__s^rt__yeah | but i think also - i think a good first indicator is when the - the - the researcher looks at examples of the data and can not see a change in how big the - the signal is when the two speaker ==__c2
__s__yeah yeah .__c4
__b__then that's a problem right there .__c2
__b__so i think you should at least be able ==__c2
__fh|s__oh yeah .__c3
__s__doing casual looking and can get the sense hey there's something there .__c2
__s__and then you can play around with the measures .__c2
__b__oh yeah .__c3
__fg|s.%-__yeah .__c4
__fg|%-__and when he's looking in the log domain he's not really seeing it .__c2
__s__so ==__c2
__s__and when he's looking in straight energy he is .__c2
__s__so that's a good place to start .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^bd^df__um | so that was - that was the discussion we just had .__c2
__b.%__um | the other thing ==__c2
__b__actually we ca- - had a question for adam in this .__c2
__s__uh when you did the sampling uh over the speech segments or s- - or sampling over the - the individual channels in order to do the e- - uh the amplitude equalization did you do it over just the entire - everything in the mike channels ?__c2
__b__how ==__c4
__%--__you didn't try to find speech ?__c2
__s^e__no | i just took over the entire s- - uh entire channel .__c0
__s^co.%-__um | sampled ten minutes randomly .__c0
__b__right okay .__c2
__qy^bu^rt__so then that means that someone who didn't speak very much would be largely represented by silence .__c2
__s^na__yep .__c0
__s^na__and someone who would - who would be ==__c2
__b__so the normalization factor probably is i- - i- - i- - is - is ==__c2
__s__yeah | this was quite quick and dirty and it was just for listening .__c0
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__yeah .__c2
__b__okay .__c2
__s^co__and for listening it seems to work really well .__c0
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__b__so ==__c0
__qw.%-__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__but that's ==__c2
__s.%-__right .__c2
__b__but it's not - not a good measure .__c0
__s__so th- ==__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__okay .__c2
__s__so yeah there - there - there - there's a good chance then given that different people do talk different amounts that there is - there - there is still a lot more to be gained from gain norm- - normalization with some sort ==__c2
__b__yeah yeah .__c4
__b__huh .__c4
__s^2__yes absolutely .__c0
__b__if - if we can figure out a way to do it .__c2
__s^cs__yeah .__c4
__b__uh | but we were agreed that in addition to that uh there should be s- - stuff related to pitch and harmonics and so forth .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__so we didn't talk at all about uh the other derivatives .__c2
__fg|s__but uh again just - just looking at ==__c2
__b__uh i think uh liz has a very good point that in fact it would be much more graphic just to show ==__c2
__s^cs.%--__yeah .__c4
__s__well actually you do have some distributions here uh for these cases .__c2
__s^cs__yeah .__c4
__s__you have some histograms .__c2
__s^e__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__um and uh | they don't look very separate .__c2
__s__uh | separated .__c2
__b__this is the - the first derivate of log of frame energy uh without any kind of normalization .__c4
__qy^rt__what ?==__c3
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s^ar|s.%-__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c2
__%-__log energy .__c3
__s^no__these the- - these are the - the first experiments uh with comment uh ==__c4
__s^co^rt__sorry .__c3
__s__frame energy .__c3
__s^cs.%-__except that it's hard to judge this because the - they're not normalized .__c0
__s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt__it's just number of frames .__c0
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__but yeah even so .__c0
__b__w- - i mean what i meant is even if you use linear you know raw measures like raw energy or whatever .__c3
__s__number ==__c2
__s^bk__maybe we shouldn't make any assumptions about the distribution's shape .__c3
__b__and just use - you know use the distribution to model the - the mean .__c3
__s^co__or what - y- - you know rather than the mean take some ==__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__but - and so in - in these he's got that .__c2
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__he's got some pictures .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s^ba__but he doesn't - he doesn't in the - he- - i ==__c2
__s__just in derivatives but not in the ==__c2
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__oh .__c3
__s^df.%--__but he d- - but he doesn't - doesn't ==__c2
__fg__right | so we don't know what they look like on the - tsk - for the raw .__c3
__s__but he didn't h- - have it for the energy .__c2
__b__he had it for the derivatives .__c2
__qy.%-__yeah .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__so ==__c3
__qy^bu^rt__yeah .__c2
__qy^rt__i mean there might be something there .__c3
__qrr.%--__i don't know .__c3
__s__huh .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^cs__interesting .__c0
__fh__here i - i ==__c4
__s^bk__oh that - yeah that's a good q- ==__c2
__s^e__in - no i - i - i haven't the result .__c4
__s^bk^m__did - did you have this sort of thing for just the - just the l- - r- - uh the - the unnormalized log energy ?__c2
__fh|s.%--__okay yeah .__c2
__s.%--__so she - she's right .__c2
__s__but it's the - it's the - the - the following .__c4
__s__that's a  ==__c2
__s__well it might be just good to know what it looks like .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__b__because ==__c3
__qr__that's - that's uh because i'd mentioned scatter plots before but she's right .__c2
__%-__huh ?__c4
__s__i mean even before you get the scatter plots just looking at a single feature uh looking at the distribution is a good thing to do .__c2
__qh__yeah .__c4
__b__catal- - uh - combining the different possibilities of uh the parameters .__c4
__b__i - i - i - i mean the - the - the scatter plot combining uh different n- - two combination .__c4
__s__yeah | but - but what she's saying is which is right is le- ==__c2
__s:s^fe__combination of two of energy and derivate ==__c4
__fg|s.%--__i mean let's start with the ==__c2
__s.%--__before we get complicated let's start with the most basic wh- - thing which is we're arguing that if you take energy - uh if you look at the energy that when two people are speaking at the same time usually there'll be more energy than when one is .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__right ?__c2
__b__that's - that sort of hypothesis .__c2
__s.%--__that's right .__c4
__s.%--__and the first way you'd look at that uh s- - she's you know absolutely right .__c2
__b__is that you would just take a look at the distribution of those two things .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^j__much as you've plotted them here .__c2
__s__you know but just - but just - just uh do it ==__c2
__s.%-__yeah .__c4
__s^df__well in this case you have three .__c2
__b__you have the silence and that - that's fine .__c2
__b.%__yeah .__c4
__s__so uh with three colors or three shades or whatever .__c2
__b__just - just look at those distributions .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__and then given that as a base you can see if that gets improved you know or - or - or worsened by the - looking at regular energy looking at log energy .__c2
__s__we were just proposing that maybe it's - you know it's harder to see with the log energy .__c2
__s^ba__yeah .__c4
__s^ba__um and uh | also these different normalizations does a particular choice of normalization make it better ?__c2
__%--__but i had maybe made it too complicated by suggesting early on that you look at scatter plots .__c2
__fh|s__because that's looking at a distribution in two dimensions .__c2
__s^ba__let's start off just in one uh with this feature .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__yeah .__c4
__%--__i think that's probably the most basic thing before anything very complicated .__c2
__s.%-__yeah .__c3
__fg__um | and then we- - w- - i think we're agreed that pitch related things are - are - are going to be a - a really likely candidate to help .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__i agree yeah .__c4
__fh__uhhuh .__c4
__s^ba__um but since - uh your intuition from looking at some of the data is that when you looked at the regular energy that it did in fact usually go up when two people were talking that's - uh you know you should be able to come up with a measure which will match your intuition .__c2
__s^ba|s^ft__okay .__c4
__s^2^j__yeah .__c4
__fg__yeah .__c4
__s__yeah yeah yeah .__c4
__s^df__and she's right that a - that having a - having - having this table with a whole bunch of things with the standard deviation the variance and so forth it's - it's - it's harder to interpret than just looking at the - the same kind of picture you have here .__c2
__s^bk__but ==__c4
__s^j__uhhuh .__c4
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__but - it - it's curious but uh i f- - i found it in the - in the mixed file in one channel that uh in several - oh e- - uh several times uh you have an speaker talking alone with a high level of energy .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c2
__fg__uhhuh .__c2
__s^bk|s^t__uh in the middle uh a zone of overlapping with huh less energy .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c2
__h__and uh come with another speaker with high energy .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__and the overlapping zone has uh less energy .__c4
__s__yeah | so there'll be some cases for which ==__c2
__fh__because there reach very many ==__c4
__s^rt__right .__c3
__s^rt__but the qu- - so - so they'll be ==__c2
__s^rt__this is - i w- - want to point to visual things .__c2
__s^rt__but i mean they - there'll be time - there'll be overlap between the distributions .__c2
__s__but the question is if it's a reasonable feature at all there's some separation .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__fh|s.%--__yeah .__c4
__fh|%--__especially locally .__c3
__fh__uhhuh .__c2
__s__so locally ==__c3
__s__just locally yeah .__c4
__s__and - i was just going to say that - that right now we're just exploring .__c0
__s__and the other thing is i- ==__c3
__s.%-__sorry .__c3
__s__i ==__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__fh__what you would imagine eventually is that you'll feed all of these features into some discriminative system .__c0
__b__yeah .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^fa__and so even if - if one of the features does a good job at one type of overlap another feature might do a good job at another type of overlap .__c0
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^bd|s.%--__yeah .__c4
__fg|s__yeah this is the ==__c4
__s__right | i mean the - the reason i had suggested the scatter f- - p- - features is i used to do this a lot when we had thirteen or fifteen or twenty features to look at .__c2
__s__um because something is a good feature uh by itself you don't really know how it'll behave in combination .__c2
__s__and so it's nice to have as many - as many together at the same time as possible in uh in some reasonable visual form .__c2
__s__there's cool graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny - funny way .__c2
__s__but it's true that you shouldn't do any of that unless you know that the individual ones at least have - have some uh - some hope .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s^bd^no__well especially for normalizing .__c3
__s__i mean it's really important to pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c2
__qrr.%--__and it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same .__c3
__h|s^aa__e- - actually i was wondering right now you're taking a - all of the speech from the whole meeting and you're trying to find points of overlap .__c3
__s__but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker .__c3
__s__right ?__c3
__s^bk.%__right .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__fh__so i mean another way would just be to take the speech from just say morgan and just jane and then just their overlaps .__c3
__s__like - but by hand .__c3
__s__by cheating .__c3
__s^bk__and looking at you know if you can detect something that way .__c3
__s__because if we can't do it that way there's no good way that we're going to be able to do it .__c3
__s__no prayer .__c0
__s^bu__that - you know there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just individuals and then that combination alone .__c3
__fg__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__plus i think it has more elegant - e- ==__c3
__s^aa^r__uhhuh .__c2
__s^ba__the m- - the right model will be easier to see that way .__c3
__b__so if - i don't know if you go through and you find adam because he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e- - enough speech ==__c3
__fg|s^t.%--__yeah .__c4
__s^bsc__and just sort of look at those three cases of adam and the other person and the overlaps .__c3
__fh|s__yeah .__c4
__s^e__maybe ==__c3
__b.%__and just look at the distributions maybe there is a clear pattern .__c3
__s^2__yeah .__c4
__s^e__uhhuh .__c4
__s^bu__but we just can't see it because there's too many combinations of - of people that can overlap .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s__i had the same intuition last - last - last week .__c1
__s^cs__so ==__c3
__s^ba__yeah ?__c4
__s^ba__just seems sort of complex .__c3
__s__i think it's - to start with it's s- - your - your idea of simplifying .__c1
__b__starting with something that you can see uh you know without the extra layers of ==__c1
__s^ba^m__right .__c3
__s^cs__because if energy doesn't matter there like ==__c3
__fh|s.%--__i don't think this is true but what if ==__c3
__s__to study individual .__c4
__fh|s^cc__huh ?__c3
__s^tc__sorry .__c1
__s^e__what ?__c1
__s^e__to study individual .__c4
__fh__well you - you - you don't have to study everybody individually .__c1
__s__well to study the simplest case to get rid of extra ==__c3
__fh|s.%--__the - the - the - but - consider ==__c4
__s__but just simple case .__c1
__s__and the one that has the lot of data associated with it .__c1
__s__right .__c3
__s__because what if it's the case and i don't think this is true ==__c3
__s__that was a great overlap by the way .__c0
__b__what if it's the case that when two people overlap they equate their - you know there's a conservation of energy and everybody ?==__c3
__s^cs^tc__both people talk more softly ?__c3
__s^cs^e__i don't think this happens at all .__c3
__b^rt__or - or what if what if the equipment - what if the equipment adjusts somehow ?__c1
__s^cs^e__or they get louder .__c3
__s^bk__there's some equalizing in there .__c1
__b__yeah or ==__c3
__s^ng__uh | no we don't have that .__c2
__fh|s.%-__i mean ==__c3
__b__but ==__c2
__qy^bu^rt__well but - but i think that's what i was saying about different types of overlap .__c0
__s^aa__okay .__c1
__s^ba__saturation .__c1
__s__there are - there are different types .__c3
__b__and within those types ==__c3
__s^bu__like as jose was saying that sounded like a backchannel overlap .__c3
__fh__meaning the kind that's a friendly encouragement like uhhuh .__c3
__s^na__great .__c3
__s.%-__yeah .__c3
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__and it doesn't take - you don't take the floor .__c3
__s^ar__um but some of those as you showed i think can be discriminated by the duration of the overlap .__c3
__s^nd__yeah .__c4
__s__so ==__c3
__b__it - actually the s- - new student don who um adam has met and he was at one of our meetings ==__c3
__s.%--__he's getting his feet wet and then he'll be starting again in mid january .__c3
__b__he's interested in trying to distinguish the types of overlap .__c3
__s__i don't know if he's talked with you yet .__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__but in sort of honing in on these different types .__c3
__s__i don't consi- - now i don't consider that possibility .__c4
__s^r__and - so maybe ==__c3
__b__this is a s- - a general studio of the overlapping we're studying the - i- ==__c4
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s__so it might be something that we can help by categorizing some of them and then you know look at that .__c3
__b__well i - i - i - i would s- - actually still recommend that he do the overall thing .__c2
__s^cs.%-__because it would be the quickest thing for him to do .__c2
__s^aa__he could - you see he already has all his stuff in place .__c2
__s^2^bk__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__he has the histogram mechanism .__c2
__fg|s__he has the stuff that subtracts out ==__c2
__b__and all he has to do is change it uh uh from - from log to plain energy and plot the histogram and look at it .__c2
__b__and then he should go on and do the other stuff bec- ==__c2
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__but - but this will ==__c2
__s^aa__yeah | no i didn't mean that - that - for you to do that .__c3
__b__but i was thinking if - if don and i are trying to get categories .__c3
__fh__uhhuh .__c2
__s^2^j__and we label some data for you and we say this is what we think is going ==__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c2
__s^aa__so you don't have to worry about it .__c3
__fg|s__and here's the three types of overlaps .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__b__and we'll - we'll do the labelling for you .__c3
__s^j__yeah .__c4
__b__huh huh .__c2
__fg|s^ng__um ==__c3
__s^tc__consider different class of overlap ?__c4
__s^tc__yeah that we would be working on anyway .__c3
__s^t__if there's time .__c4
__qy^rt^t__yeah .__c4
__fh__then maybe you can try some different things for those three cases and see if that helps or ==__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__this is the thing i - i comment with you before that uh we have a great variation of th- - situation of overlapping .__c4
__fh|qy.%--__uhhuh .__c2
__s__and the behavior for energy is uh log energy is not uh the same all the time .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk__and ==__c4
__s^e__but i guess i was just saying that - that right now uh from the means that you gave i don't have any sense of whether even you know there are any significant number of cases for which there is distinct ==__c2
__s^aa__and i would imagine there should be some - you know there should be - the distributions should be somewhat separated .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__qr^cs__yeah .__c4
__s^no__uh and i - i would still guess that if they are not separated at all that there's some - there's - there's most likely something wrong in the way that we're measuring it .__c2
__s^ar__yeah .__c4
__s^e__yeah .__c4
__s^nd__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__um but um | for instance i mean i wouldn't expect that it was very common overall that when two people were talking at the same time that it would - that it really was lower .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__s__although sometimes as you say it would .__c2
__s^no__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__yeah | no that was - that was a jok- ==__c3
__qy.%--__so so ==__c2
__s__or a sort of a case where - where you would never know that unless you actually go and look at two individuals .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__qy^rt__i mean ==__c2
__s^na__no .__c2
__s^bk__it could - it probably does happen sometimes .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__s^e__right .__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__mind if i turned that light off ?__c0
__s__so ==__c3
__qy^rt__the flickering is annoying me .__c0
__s.%-__okay .__c2
__b.%__it might the case though that the significant energy just as jose was saying comes in the non backchannel cases .__c3
__s^aa__because in back- - most people when they're talking don't change their own energy when they get a backchannel .__c3
__b__because they're not really predicting the backchannel .__c3
__s^am__uhhuh .__c2
__s^am^r__and sometimes it's a nod and sometimes it's an uhhuh .__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^e__and the uhhuh is really usually very low energy .__c3
__s^no__yeah .__c4
__fh__so maybe those don't actually have much difference in energy .__c3
__s__but all the other cases might .__c3
__fg__and the backchannels are sort of easy to spot s- - in terms of their words or ==__c3
__s__e- - e- - and - and again what they - what difference there was would kind of be lost in taking the log .__c2
__s__i mean just listen to it .__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__so ==__c3
__s.%--__so ==__c2
__s^no__well it would be lost no matter what you do .__c3
__s__but ==__c4
__fh|s__as well .__c2
__s^df__yeah .__c4
__fh__it just ==__c3
__s__huh no .__c2
__s^df__if it's - if i- - if it's ==__c2
__b__tone ==__c0
__s^df__well it won't be as big .__c2
__s__i mean even if you take the log you can - your model just has a more sensitive measures .__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__fh|s^df__sure | but tone might be very ==__c0
__s.%-__so ==__c3
__qy^bu^rt__yeah you're uhhuh tone is going to be very different .__c0
__s^ar|s^ng__yeah .__c3
__b__right right .__c3
__fh__you could imagine doing specialized ones for different types of back channels if you could - if you had a good model for it .__c0
__s.%--__your uhhuh detector .__c0
__s^e__if - if you're - a- - i guess my point is if you're doing essentially a linear separation taking the log first does in fact make it harder to separate .__c2
__s__right .__c0
__s.%__yeah .__c4
__s__so it's - so uh if you i- - i- - so i- - if there - if there close to things it does ==__c2
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^fe__it's a nonlinear operation that does in fact change the distinction .__c2
__s.%--__if you're doing a non- - if you're doing some fancy thing then - then ==__c2
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__and right now we're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and - and saying we're going to cut it here .__c2
__s__um and that - that's the indicator that we're getting .__c2
__fh__but anyway yeah we're not disagreeing on any of this .__c2
__s__we should look at it more uh - more finely but uh uh i think that - this often happens you do fairly complicated things and then you stand back from them and you realize that you haven't done something simple .__c2
__s^ba__so uh if you generated something like that just for the energy and see and then a- - a- - a- - as - as liz says when they g- - have uh uh smaller um more coherent groups to look at that would be another interesting thing later .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s^aa^m__uhhuh .__c4
__s__and then that should give us some indication - between those should give us some indication of whether there's anything to be achieved f- - from energy at all .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__and then you can move on to the uh uh more pitch related stuff .__c2
__s^aa|s^j__uhhuh .__c4
__b__i - i - i think this is a good idea .__c4
__%--__okay .__c2
__s__not consider the log energy .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c2
__fh__but then the ==__c2
__s__have you started looking at the pitch related stuff at all ?__c2
__b__or ?==__c2
__fh|s__@reject@ the ?==__c4
__s__pitch related .__c2
__s:qy__harmonicity and so on .__c2
__fh|qy^d^g^rt__i - i'm preparing the - the program but i don't - i don't begin because uh i saw your email .__c4
__s^aa__preparing to ==__c2
__s:qy__yeah .__c2
__s^aa^r__and i agree with you it's better to - i suppose it's better to - to consider the - the energy this kind of parameter bef- ==__c4
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^cs__oh that's not what i meant .__c2
__s^cs.%--__no no .__c2
__s__i - i - i - i ==__c2
__qy^cs^rt__well we certainly should see this but i - i - i - i think that the harm- ==__c2
__qy^cs^rt__i certainly wasn't saying this was better than the harmonicity and pitch related things .__c2
__s^ng__i was just saying ==__c2
__s^bk__i - i go on with the - with the pitch .__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__b__aha okay .__c4
__s^bk__yeah i was just saying ==__c2
__s.%--__i - i - i - i understood uh that uh i - i had to finish by the moment with the and - and concentrate my - my energy in that problem .__c4
__s__okay .__c2
__s__okay okay .__c2
__s^aa__but i think like all these derivatives and second derivatives and all these other very fancy things ==__c2
__s__i think i would just sort of look at the energy and then get into the harmonicity as - as a suggestion .__c2
__s^ba__okay .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__i go on with the pitch .__c4
__s__uh okay .__c2
__qy.%-__so maybe uh since w- - we're trying to uh compress the meeting .__c2
__h|s^aap__um i know adam had some form stuff he wanted to talk about .__c2
__s__and did you have some ?==__c2
__s.%-__i wanted to ask just s- - something on the end of this top- - topic .__c1
__s^e__so when i presented my results about the uh distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers at the bottom of that i did have a proposal .__c1
__%--__uhhuh .__c4
__s^no__and i had plan to go through with it of - of co- - coding the types of overlaps that people were involved in s- - just with reference to speaker style so you know with reference .__c1
__s__oh .__c3
__s^aa__that'd be great .__c3
__s__and you know i said that on my - in my summary .__c1
__b__yeah i remem- ==__c3
__%-__that you know so it's like people may have different amounts of being overlapped with or overlapping .__c1
__s__right .__c3
__b__but that in itself is not informative without knowing what types of overlaps they're involved in .__c1
__b__so i was planning to do a taxonomy of types overlaps with reference to that .__c1
__b__that would be great .__c3
__%--__yeah .__c4
__b__that would be really great .__c3
__s^cs__so but it you know it's like it sounds like you also have uh something in that direction .__c1
__s^cs__huh .__c0
__s^bk__is - is it ?==__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__we have nothing ==__c3
__fh__you know basically we got his environment set up .__c3
__s.%-__he's - he's a double e you know .__c3
__s^bs__so it's mostly that if we had to label it ourselves we - we would or we'd have to to get started .__c3
__b__but if - it - it would be much better if you can do it .__c3
__s__you'd be much better at doing it also .__c3
__s^e__because you know i - i'm not - i don't have a good feel for how they should be sorted out .__c3
__s^df.%--__interesting .__c1
__s^df__and i really didn't want to go into that if i didn't have to .__c3
__fh|s__so if - if you're w- - willing to do that or - or ==__c3
__s.%--__well maybe we can ==__c1
__s^cs__it would be interesting though to talk maybe not at the meeting but at some other time about what are the classes .__c0
__s^df__okay .__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^cs.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__%--__yeah .__c3
__s^bd__yeah .__c4
__s^cs.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__s^cs.%--__i think that's a research effort in and of itself .__c3
__s^cs__yeah it would be interesting .__c0
__s^cs__because you can read the literature but i don't know how it'll turn out .__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__and you know it's always an interesting question .__c3
__%-__i would think it's interesting yeah .__c4
__qy^d^g.%--__it seems like we also s- - with reference to a purpose too that we we'd want to have them coded .__c1
__%-__yeah .__c4
__s^no^rt__that'd be great .__c3
__s^df.%--__yeah .__c4
__s__yep .__c0
__s.%-__that'd be really great .__c3
__fg|s^cs^ng__okay .__c1
__s__and we'd still have some funding for this project .__c3
__s^ba__i can do that .__c1
__s__uh uh ==__c4
__s__like probably if we had to hire some - like an undergrad because uh don is being covered half time on something else .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__s.%--__i mean he - we're not paying him the full r a ship for - all the time .__c3
__qw.%--__so um if we got it to where we wanted - we needed someone to do that ==__c3
__s__i don't think there's really enough data where - where ==__c3
__s^cs.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__s__yeah i see this as a prototype to use the only the - the already transcribed meeting as just a prototype .__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^rt__i - i think a- - a- - another parameter we c- - we - we can consider is uh the duration .__c4
__s^bc__but ==__c3
__%--__uhhuh .__c0
__%--__another e- - e- - m- - besides uh the - the class of overlap the duration .__c4
__b__because is possible uh some s- - s- - um uh some classes uh has uh a type of a duration .__c4
__s__uh a duration very short uh when we have - we have overlapping with speech .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__b__yeah definitely .__c3
__b__yeah maybe - it may be correlated .__c1
__b__is possible to have ==__c4
__s^cs.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__s__and it's interesting i think to consider the - the window of normalization .__c4
__s__normalization window .__c4
__s__uh because uh if we have a type of a kind of uh overlap uh back channel overlap with a short duration is possible uh to normali- ==__c4
__s__i- - i- - that if we normalize uh with uh uh consider only the - the uh window uh by the left uh ri- - uh side on the right side overlapping with a - a very uh oh a small window ==__c4
__qy^rt__uh the - if the fit of normalization is uh huh bigger uh in that overlapping zone uh very short .__c4
__s^no^rt__uhhuh .__c1
__%--__yeah that's true .__c3
__fg|s__the window shouldn't be larger than the backchannel .__c3
__fh__i - i me- - i - i understand .__c4
__s__i mean that you have uh you have a backchannel uh uh - you have a overlapping zone very short .__c4
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__and you consider uh n- - uh all the channel to normalize this very short uh ==__c4
__s^cs.%--__uhhuh .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s^nd__for example huh uhhuh huh uh .__c4
__s__and the energy is not uh height .__c4
__%-__uh i think if you consider all the channel to normalize and the channel is huh bigger uh uh uh compared with the - with the overlapping uh duration .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__uh the effect is huh stronger .__c4
__s__uh that i - i mean the - the e- - effect of the normalization uh with the mean and the - and the variance uh is different that if you consider only a window compared uh with the n- - the duration of overlapping .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c2
__s__not ==__c4
__s__you - you want it around the overlapping part .__c2
__s^rt__you want it to include something that's not in overlapping .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__but - but uh ==__c2
__s.%-__yeah .__c4
__s^aap__uhhuh .__c1
__s^aa^m.%--__i - i don't know .__c4
__s^aa__is - s- - if ==__c4
__s__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__well it's a sliding window .__c3
__b__right ?__c3
__s^rt__so if you take the - the measure in the center of the overlapped piece you know there'd better be some- - something .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^bk|s^aap__yeah .__c4
__s^rt__but if your window is really huge then yeah you're right .__c3
__fh__you won't even ==__c3
__s^aa|s__yeah this is the - this is the - the idea to consider only the - the small window near - near - near the - the overlapping zone .__c4
__b__the portion of the - of the backchannel won't - won't effect anything .__c3
__s__but you ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__fg|s__so ==__c3
__qy^d^f^g__you know you shouldn't be more than ==__c3
__b__like - you should definitely not be three times as big as your - as your backchannel .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s__then you're going to w- - have a wash .__c3
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__fh|s__and hopefully it's more like on the order of ==__c3
__fh__i'm not sure that's necessarily true .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^cc__it is an empirical question it seems like .__c1
__qy^rt__yea- ==__c3
__%--__because - because it - because um again if you're just compensating for the gain ==__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__fg|%-__yeah .__c1
__s^aa|s__you know the fact that this - this gain thing was crude .__c2
__s__and the gain wh- - if someone is speaking relatively at consistent level just to - to give a - an extreme example all you're doing is compensating for that .__c2
__s__and then you still s- - and then if you look at the frame with respect to that it still should - should uh change .__c2
__s__yeah | it depends how different your normalization is as you slide your window across .__c3
__b__i mean that's something we don't know .__c3
__s^bs.%-__uhhuh .__c2
__b__it's possible to try it both ways .__c1
__s^aa|s__well i mean we're also talking about a couple of different things .__c0
__s__isn't it ?__c1
__s.%-__in this small @reject@ ==__c1
__fg|s__i mean one is your analysis window and then the other is any sort of normalization that you're doing .__c0
__s^bk|s^na__yeah | i was talking about the n- - normalization window .__c3
__fg|s__and the - and they could be quite different .__c0
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__right .__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__s__this was sort of where - where we were last week .__c2
__s:qw__yeah .__c3
__s__that's true yeah .__c3
__qo^df__yep .__c0
__s__but anyway we - we'll have to look at some core things .__c2
__b__um ==__c3
__s^cs__okay .__c4
__s^bk__okay .__c1
__b__but that'd be great if - if you're marking those ==__c3
__s__and um ==__c3
__s__great .__c1
__b__okay .__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^ba__but it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks .__c3
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c1
__s__and i was assuming that will be inherited because if you have the words and they're roughly aligned in time via forced alignment or whatever we end up using then you know this student and i would be looking at the time marks .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__yep i agree .__c1
__qy.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__s__and classifying all the frames inside those as whatever labels jane gave .__c3
__qy^rt__coming off of the other ==__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^bu__good .__c1
__s^bu__so it wouldn't be i wasn't planning to label the time marks .__c1
__s^bk|s^bu__@reject@ .__c3
__b__i can give you my transcription file .__c4
__fh__i was thinking that that would come from the engineering side .__c1
__qy^rt__i don't think you need to .__c3
__s^am__no ?__c4
__qy^rt^t1__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah | that should be linked to the words which are linked to time somehow .__c3
__s^no__there you go .__c1
__s^cc__right ?__c3
__s^bk__well we're not any time soon going to get a forced alignment .__c0
__s^ft^tc__not now .__c3
__b__so ==__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__b__um if it's not hand marked then we're not going to get the times .__c0
__b__well it's something that w- ==__c3
__s__well we - we wouldn't be able to do any work without a forced alignment anyway .__c3
__s.%--__yes ==__c4
__s.%-__so somehow if - once he gets going we're going to have to come up with one .__c3
__s^f__and ==__c3
__s__yes .__c2
__qy^rt__yeah .__c3
__s^df__good good .__c1
__s.%--__i mean w- - i guess we could do a very bad one with broadcast news .__c0
__b__so whatever you would label would be attached to the words i think .__c3
__%-__great !__c1
__s__good good .__c1
__b__yeah .__c4
__fh__uhhuh .__c1
__s__well again for the close mike stuff we could come up - take a s- - take the switchboard system or something .__c2
__s^j__that might be good enough .__c0
__s^cs__yeah .__c0
__s^ba__and um ==__c2
__fh__it'd be worth a try .__c0
__s^2^j__it would be interesting to see what we get .__c0
__s^bk__just you know low pass filter the speech and ==__c2
__s^bk__because there's - there's a lot of work you can't do without that .__c3
__fg|s__i mean how - how would you ?==__c3
__s^bk^m__yeah .__c2
__s__you'd have to go in and measure every start and stop point next to a word .__c3
__s__is y- - if you're interested in anything to do with words .__c3
__s^rt__it would be very inefficient .__c1
__s^rt__yep .__c0
__s^rt__yeah .__c4
__s__so ==__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__qw^rt__anyway | so that'd be great .__c3
__s__good okay .__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__there's something we should talk about later .__c2
__s__but maybe not just now .__c2
__fh__but uh should talk about our options as far as the uh - uh transcription .__c2
__s__but well w- - but we'll do that later .__c2
__fh__yep if i b m doesn't .__c0
__b^rt__okay .__c1
__s__good .__c1
__s.%--__do we have to turn ?==__c3
__s.%--__are we supposed to keep recording here ?__c3
__s__yeah | let's do that later .__c1
__s^ba__yeah .__c1
__s^ba^fe__yeah right .__c0
__s__we'll talk about it later .__c2
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__so uh uh ==__c2
__fh__forms .__c2
__s__you had something on forms .__c2
__s__forms next iteration of forms .__c0
__s__oops .__c0
__s^e__oh !__c1
__%--__oh good okay .__c1
__s^aa__um ==__c2
__s__oh .__c2
__s^ba__how - so it's two pages per person ?__c1
__s^bk|s__nope .__c0
__s__one's a digit form .__c0
__s^t^tc__one's a speaker form .__c0
__s__oh !__c1
__b__so one is a one time only speaker form and the other is the digits .__c0
__s__oh i see .__c1
__s.%--__oh it's the same .__c4
__s.%--__oh no no .__c4
__s^no__is - is new is okay .__c4
__s__so don't fill these out .__c0
__s__all right .__c1
__s__this is just the suggestion for uh what the new forms would look like .__c0
__s__so they incorporate the changes that we talked about .__c0
__b__date and time .__c1
__s.%--__uh why did you switch the order of the date and time fields ?__c1
__s__this is rather a low level but ==__c1
__s__on which one ?__c0
__s__on - on the new one time comes first and then date .__c1
__s__but i thought ==__c1
__s__oh you mean on the digit form ?__c0
__s__this is - this is rather a low level question but - but it used - used to be date came first .__c1
__s__uh because the user fills out the first three fields and i fill out the rest .__c0
__fh__oh i see .__c1
__s__so it was intentional .__c0
__s__well how would the - how would the user know the time if they didn't know the date ?__c1
__s__it's an interesting observation .__c0
__s^ba__but it was intentional .__c0
__s.%--__because the date is when you actually read the digits and the time and ==__c0
__s:qw__excuse me .__c0
__s__the time is when you actually read the digits but i'm filling out the date beforehand .__c0
__fh__if you look at the form in front of you that you're going to fill out when you read the digits you'll see i've already filled in the date but not the time .__c0
__fg__yeah .__c1
__qy^rt.%--__i always assumed ==__c1
__s^rt__so the time is supposed to be pretty exact .__c1
__s.%--__because i've just been taking beginning time - time of the meeting .__c1
__s^bd^df__yeah me too .__c3
__s__yeah i ==__c4
__fh|s.%--__yeah | i've noticed that in the forms .__c0
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__the - the reason i put the time in is so that the person who's extracting the digits meaning me will know where to look in the meeting to try to find the digits .__c0
__qy.%-__@reject@ ?==__c3
__qy^rt__me too .__c4
__s^no.x__oh .__c4
__s.x__oh dear !__c1
__s.%--__but - i am put - i am putting the beginning of the meeting .__c4
__s^aa__we've been - we've been messing up your forms .__c1
__s^bk__i know .__c0
__s__so you should call it like digits start time or ?==__c3
__s__and i haven't said anything .__c0
__s__yep .__c0
__qy^rt__in - on there .__c4
__b__why - what - what were you putting in ?__c2
__s^2__oh well i was saying if we started the meeting at two thirty .__c1
__%-__yeah .__c4
__s^am__i'd put two thirty and i guess d- - e- - everyone was putting two thirty .__c1
__s^aa__oh .__c2
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__and i didn't realize there was uh oh i'm about to read this and i should ==__c1
__s__no | it's about fifty fifty .__c0
__b__actually it's about one third each .__c0
__s^e__about one third of them are blank .__c0
__s^e__about one third of them are when the digits are read .__c0
__b__and about one third of them are when the meeting starts .__c0
__fh|s__oh .__c4
__s^aa__so ==__c0
__s__this would be a radical suggestion but ==__c1
__s:qw__i could put instructions ?__c0
__s:s__ei- - either that or maybe you could maybe write down when people start reading digits on that particular session .__c1
__s__nah .__c0
__fh|s__yeah .__c4
__fh|s__but if i'm not at the meeting i can't do that .__c0
__%--__i know okay .__c1
__s__yeah | he's been setting stuff up and going away so ==__c2
__s__that's a good point .__c1
__s__i see .__c1
__fh|s^cc__good point good point .__c1
__b__for some reason he doesn't want to sit through every meeting that's ==__c2
__%-__yep | but that is the reason name email and time are where they are .__c0
__s^df__oh okay .__c1
__qw^br^rt__yeah .__c2
__qy^rt__all right .__c1
__b__i rest my ==__c1
__qrr.%--__and then the others are later on .__c0
__s^ng__uhhuh .__c2
__s__okay .__c1
__s__w- ==__c1
__s__and the seat is this number ?__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__s.%-__seat and session .__c1
__b__for official use only .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__that's - well he's very professional .__c3
__s__use only ==__c4
__s^aa__actually you could ==__c1
__s^e^rt__well that does raise another question which is why is the professional use only line not higher ?__c1
__s.%-__why doesn't it come in at the point of date and seat ?__c1
__s^bu__oh | because we're filling in other things .__c1
__s^nd__what ?__c0
__s^e__what ?__c2
__s^fe__well because - if y- - your - your professional use ==__c1
__s^bk__you're going to already have the date and the s- ==__c1
__s^bk__what - which form are you talking about ?__c0
__s__well i'm comparing the new one with the old one .__c1
__s^bk__this is the digit form .__c1
__b.%__oh .__c4
__s^bk__oh you're talking about the digit form .__c0
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__digit - digit form .__c2
__s^aa__oh i wasn't supposed to ==__c1
__s.%--__the digit form doesn't - the digit ==__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__b__sorry sorry .__c1
__s.%--__no that's all right .__c0
__s^df__the digit form doesn't have a for official use only line .__c0
__s__it just has a line which is what you're supposed to read .__c0
__s__that ==__c1
__s__uh okay .__c1
__b.%__@reject@ sorry about that .__c1
__s__so on the digits form everything above the line is a fill in form .__c0
__s^fe__yeah .__c1
__s^e__yeah .__c1
__s__and everything below the line is digits that the user reads .__c0
__s^bu__okay .__c1
__s^aa__all right | s- - but i didn't mean to derail our discussion here .__c1
__s^bk__so you really wanted to start with this other form .__c1
__s^bu.%--__no | either way is fine .__c0
__s^na__i just - you just started talking about something and i didn't know which form you were referring to .__c0
__s^no__all right yeah | i was comparing ==__c1
__s.%-__so th- - this is - so i was looking at the change first .__c1
__qy^d__so it's like we started with this and now we've got a new version of it wi- - with reference to this .__c1
__s^aa.%__so the digit form .__c1
__s^na__we had one already .__c1
__b__now the f- - the fields are slightly different .__c1
__s^cs.%-__so the main thing that the person fills out um is the name and email and time ?__c2
__%-__yeah .__c4
__s^nd__right .__c0
__b__uh ==__c4
__s^m__you do the rest ?__c2
__qy^bu^rt__yep .__c0
__s^aa__just as uh - as i have for all the others .__c0
__s^na__right .__c2
__s^na__what - and there's an addition of the native language which is a bit redundant .__c1
__s^ba__this one has native language and this one does too .__c1
__s__that's because the one the digit form that has native language is the old form .__c0
__s__oh thank you thank you thank you .__c1
__s.%--__not the new form .__c0
__b__yeah .__c4
__s.%--__there we go .__c1
__s^2__oh yeah .__c1
__s^aa__i'll catch up here .__c1
__s__okay i see .__c1
__s^aa__south midland north midland ==__c2
__%--__that's the old and that's the new .__c1
__b__yeah | this was the problem with these categories .__c0
__s.%-__i - i picked those categories from timit .__c0
__s.%-__i don't know what those are .__c0
__b__actually the only way i know is from working with the data base and having to figure it out .__c3
__s__what ?==__c4
__s__with timit .__c0
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c4
__s^ng__yeah ?__c0
__fh__so is south midland like kansas ?__c2
__b__what i- ==__c4
__b__so i was going to ask ==__c0
__s^e__wh- - w- - i mean ==__c0
__b__and north midland like like - uh illinois or ?==__c2
__s__well yeah .__c3
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__nor- - um ==__c3
__s^ng__so - so what accent are we speaking ?__c0
__b__western ?__c0
__%-__by definition ?__c2
__fg|s^aa__and for simple for - for me ?__c4
__fh__is mean my native language spanish - spanish ?__c4
__fg__well ==__c2
__s__probably western yeah .__c3
__s^aa__uh the original is the center of spain and the beca- ==__c4
__qy^rt__yeah | i mean you could call it whatever you want .__c0
__s.%-__for the foreign language we couldn't classify every single one .__c0
__s^no__so i just left it blank and you can put whatever you want .__c0
__s^cc__because is different the span- - uh the spanish language from the - the north of spain of the south of the west and the ==__c4
__fh__sure .__c0
__%-__but ==__c4
__s^bk__so i'm not sure what to do about the region field for english variety .__c0
__fh|s__yeah .__c4
__s__you know when i wrote - i was writing those down i was thinking you know these are great if you're a linguist .__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__s:s__actually even if you t- ==__c3
__s.%--:s.%--__but i don't know how to - i don't know how to - i don't know how to categorize them .__c0
__s.%-__yeah .__c1
__s__if you're - if e- - if y- ==__c2
__s.%-__this wasn't developed by - th- - these regions weren't ==__c3
__s__if you're a t i or m i t from nineteen eighty five ==__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c0
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__so i guess my only question was if - if you were a south midland speaking region person would you know it ?__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__qw__is that what you would call yourself ?__c0
__qw__i don't know .__c3
__h|s__yeah .__c0
__fh__you know | i think if you're talking - if you're thinking in terms of places as opposed to names different peop- - names people have given to different ways of talking i would think north midwest and south midwest would be more common than saying midland .__c2
__s__right ?__c2
__%-__i mean i - i went to s- ==__c2
__b__yeah | now the usage ==__c3
__s^rt__maybe we can give them a li- - like a little map .__c3
__b__with the regions and they just ==__c3
__s__no i'm serious .__c3
__b__no that's not bad .__c1
__s__because it takes less time and it's sort of cute .__c3
__b__i- - at this - in that side - in that side of the - the paper .__c4
__s^cs__yeah .__c1
__s.%-__there's no figure .__c3
__%-__well ==__c2
__fh__well just a little ==__c3
__s^r.%-__you know it doesn't have all the detail .__c3
__s.%-__but you sort of ==__c3
__s^co__but what if you moved five times and - and uh ?==__c2
__fh|%--__well i was thinking you could have ma- - multiple ones and then the amount of time ==__c1
__s^bk__no | but you're categorized .__c3
__s^bk__that's the same ==__c3
__%-__so roughly ==__c1
__s^bk^r__so you could say you know ten years on the east coast five years on the west coast or something or other .__c1
__b__well we - i think we don't want to get that level of detail at this form .__c0
__b__i think that's all right if we want to follow up .__c0
__b__but ==__c0
__s^co__i guess we don't really know .__c2
__s^co__i mean i - as i said i don't think there's a huge benefit to this region thing .__c3
__b__it - it gets ==__c3
__s^ba__the problem is that for some things it's really clear and usually listening to it you can tell right away if it's a new york or boston accent .__c3
__s^df__but new york and boston are two ==__c3
__s^aa__well i guess they have the n y c .__c3
__b__but new england has a bunch of very different dialects .__c3
__s^aa__and ==__c3
__fg|qy^rt__uhhuh .__c1
__h|s.%-__and so does um s- - so do other places .__c3
__s^no__yeah so i picked these regions because we had talked about timit .__c0
__s__right .__c3
__s.%--__and those are right from timit .__c0
__fh|s__and so these would be satisfying like a speech research community if we released the database .__c3
__fh|s__so ==__c0
__s.%--__but as to whether subjects know where they're from i'm not sure because um i know that they had to fill this out for switchboard .__c3
__%--__this is i- - almost exactly the same as switchboard regions .__c3
__s^bsc__oh okay .__c1
__fh|s__or very close .__c3
__s^e__yeah .__c3
__fh__um | and i don't know how they filled that out .__c3
__s__but th- - if midland ==__c3
__s__yeah midland is the one that's difficult i guess .__c3
__s__i think a lot of people ==__c1
__s^rt__also northwest you've got oreg- - washington and oregon now which uh y- - people don't know if it's western or northern .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c1
__%-__yeah i certainly don't .__c0
__s^ar|s^ng__i mean i was saying i don't even know what i speak .__c0
__%-__it's like northwest ==__c3
__%-__oh what is northern ?__c2
__b__am i speaking - am i speaking western ?__c0
__s^m__well and what - and what's northern ?__c2
__fh__i think originally it was north - northwest .__c3
__fg__northwest .__c0
__s__yeah .__c4
__fh__but ==__c3
__fg|s__yeah so this is a real problem .__c0
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__i don't know what to do about it .__c0
__s__i wouldn't know how to characterize mine either .__c1
__s__and - and so i would think - i would say i've - i've got a mix of california and ohio .__c1
__s__i c- ==__c0
__s__i think at the first level for example we speak the same .__c0
__s^2__i don't know .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__our - our dialects or whatever you - region are the same .__c0
__fh|s.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__s__but i don't know what it is .__c0
__fh__so ==__c0
__s^bk__well you have a like techno speak accent i think .__c3
__s^bs__a techno speak accent ?__c0
__s__yeah | you know ==__c3
__s^bk__a techno- ==__c4
__s^no__a - a geek region ?__c0
__fh|s^no__well it's - i mean i - you can sort of identify ==__c3
__s^bk__geek region .__c1
__fh|s.%-__it f- - it's - it's - not - not that that's ==__c3
__s^bu__is different - is different .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__but - but maybe that - maybe we could leave this .__c3
__s^ar|s^ng.%--__and see what people - see what people choose .__c3
__s__and then um let them just fill in if they don't ==__c3
__s^2__i mean i don't know what else we can do because - that's north midland .__c3
__s__i'm wondering about a question like where are you from mostly .__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__but i - i'm s- - i'm - now that you mentioned it though i am - really am confused by northern .__c2
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__i agree i agree .__c1
__s__i really am .__c2
__s^ba__yeah .__c4
__s^df.%-__i mean if if - you're in new england that's north .__c2
__s^2__i agree .__c1
__s^aa|s__if you're - i- - if you're ==__c2
__s^ba__scandinavian the minnesota area's north .__c1
__b__uh | yeah that's ==__c2
__s__but that's also north midland .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__right ?__c2
__s^e__oh @reject@ .__c1
__s__and - and - and oregon and - and oregon and washington are - are western but they're also northern .__c2
__qw__yeah .__c3
__s^nd__okay .__c1
__s.%-__of course that's very different from like michigan or ==__c3
__s.%-__huh .__c4
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__s__uh idaho ?__c2
__s__well there are hardly any subjects from idaho .__c3
__s^bu__montana ?__c2
__fh__no problem .__c0
__s^e.%-__just rule them out .__c1
__s^aap.%-__there's only a few people in idaho .__c3
__s^am__there are hardly any subjects from beep !__c0
__s^co__yeah .__c4
__fh__sorry .__c3
__s^aa__no that's ==__c3
__s^co__maybe - maybe we - maybe we should put a little map and say put an x on where you're from .__c2
__fg__and - is - in those ==__c4
__s__yeah really .__c0
__s.%--__and if you put ==__c4
__fh__we could ask where they're from .__c3
__fh|s__it'd be pretty simple yeah .__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__fh__but- - we went back to that .__c3
__s^no__yeah .__c4
__fg|s^cc__if you put uh the state ==__c4
__fh__well well we sort of ==__c0
__s^df__where are you from mostly .__c1
__fg|s__we - we went - we went around this and then a lot of people ended up saying that it ==__c3
__s^ba__@reject@ uhhuh uhhuh .__c4
__fh__you know .__c3
__s^ba^e__well i like the idea of asking what variety of english do you speak as opposed to where you're from .__c0
__s^bk^m__because th- - if we start asking where we're from again you have to start saying well is that the language you speak or is that just where you're from .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__fg|%-__huh .__c1
__s^cs__right right .__c3
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__let's ==__c2
__s__i mean it gives us good information on where they're from but that doesn't tell us anything ==__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__qy^rt__and ==__c0
__h|s__we could always ask them if they're from ==__c2
__s__well enough about their ==__c3
__s__i mean | so - so i would say germany .__c0
__s.%--__like ==__c3
__s^bk__you know am i speaking with german accent ?__c0
__s^bk__oh .__c1
__s^ba__i don't think so .__c0
__s^r.%-__right .__c3
__s^aa__well see i'm thinking where are you from mostly .__c1
__s^bk__oh okay yeah .__c0
__b__because you know then you have some - some kind of subjective amount of time factored into it .__c1
__s^cs.%--__yeah .__c4
__b__yeah .__c4
__fh|s__yep .__c0
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^cs__yeah i guess i could try to put - squeeze in a little map .__c0
__b__i mean there's not a lot of r- - of room .__c0
__s^ba__i'd say uh boston new york city the south and regular .__c2
__s^aa__well ==__c1
__s__i think of those northern is the only one that i don't even know what they're meaning .__c0
__s^e__oh i don't know .__c3
__s^2^aa__and - and - um and usually here - people here know what is their kind of huh lang- - english language .__c4
__b__yeah yeah .__c1
__s^aa__that's a joke .__c2
__s__that's ==__c2
__b__so let's make it up .__c3
__s^cc__s- - i mean who cares ?__c3
__s^bk__right ?__c3
__s^bk^r__we can make up our own .__c3
__b__so we can say northwest rest of west or something .__c3
__b__you know .__c3
__s^ba__west ==__c3
__s.%--__and i mean ==__c3
__s__ye- ==__c0
__s.%--__i don't think the northwest people speak any differently than i do .__c0
__s.%--__it doesn't even ==__c3
__s^rt__yeah exactly .__c3
__s.%--__that's not really a region .__c3
__fh__do you come from the louisiana purchase ?__c2
__s__i ==__c1
__s^rt__so we could take out north - northern .__c3
__s.%--__you sure that people here know what is the - the kind of l- - english language uh he ?==__c0
__s.%--__uh here- - is easy for people to know ?__c4
__s__that - that's exactly what we're arguing about .__c0
__s__that's ==__c3
__s^f__yeah | w- - it's - in - it's - it's harder in america anywhere else basically .__c3
__h__we don't know .__c0
__qw.%--__because you have ==__c4
__s__i mean some of them are very obvious .__c0
__qw__if you - if you talk to someone speaking with southern drawl you know .__c0
__qy__n- - m- - yeah .__c4
__s__yeah | or boston .__c1
__s__or boston yeah .__c0
__s.%-__i can't do it but ==__c1
__s.%--__or boston ?__c4
__s^df__and those people if you ask them to self identify their accent they know .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s.%--__yeah they do .__c1
__s.%--__they know very well .__c3
__s__yeah i agree i agree i agree .__c1
__fg|s__they know they don't speak the same as the ==__c3
__b__but is boston new england ?__c0
__b__and they're proud of it .__c1
__s__day o- ==__c3
__s^2.%-__yeah .__c1
__s^bk^m__yeah exactly .__c3
__b__it's identity thing .__c1
__s__and they're glad to tell you .__c3
__s__@reject@ style .__c4
__s__well depends who you ask i suppose .__c3
__s__w- - i guess that's the problem with these categories .__c0
__s.%--__@reject@ .__c4
__s__but that's why they have new york city but ==__c3
__b__well we ca- - well why can't we just say characterize - something like char- - characterize your accent ?__c1
__s^rt__well boston's @reject@ too .__c2
__s__or ==__c3
__fh|s__characterize your accent if you can .__c3
__b.%__and - and so i would say i don't know .__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__fh|s^bd^df__right | which probably means you have a very ==__c3
__fh__but someone from boston with a really strong coloration would know .__c1
__s__and so would an r less maine - or something .__c1
__fh__and that's actually good .__c3
__s^cs__yeah .__c4
__s__i was - i was thinking of something along that line .__c3
__qy^g^rt__yeah .__c1
__s^e__how ?==__c2
__qw__because if you don't know then you know ruling out the fact that you're totally inept or something ==__c3
__b__good .__c1
__s__huh .__c1
__b__if somebody doesn't know it probably means their accent isn't very strong compared to the sort of midwest standard .__c3
__b__well i mean it wasn't that long ago that we had somebody here who was from texas who was absolutely sure that he didn't have any accent left .__c2
__s^am__huh .__c1
__s^arp^ng__and - and had - he had a pretty noticeable drawl .__c2
__b__okay so | i propose take out northern add don't know .__c0
__s^bk__oh yeah | i - i would say more - more sweepingly how would you characterize your accent .__c1
__fg|s.%-__yeah .__c4
__s__so you want to change the instructions also not just say region ?__c0
__s^df__w- ==__c3
__s^na__well i think this discussion has made me think that's s- - something to consider .__c1
__s^bk__i don't know .__c0
__b__if i - if i read this form i think they're going to ask it - they're going to answer the same way if you say what's variety of english do you speak .__c0
__s.%-__region .__c0
__s^bu__as if you say what variety of region - region do you speak .__c0
__%-__please characterize your accent .__c0
__s^bu^e__they're going to answer the same way .__c0
__s^aa|s^na__i guess ==__c1
__s.%-__well i was not sure that ==__c1
__s^aa|s^cs__huh .__c4
__b__i ==__c1
__s__so i was suggesting not having the options .__c1
__s__just having them ==__c1
__s__oh i see .__c0
__b__huh .__c4
__fh__well what we talked about with that is is so that they would understand the granularity .__c0
__s^ba__yes | but if as liz is suggesting people who have strong accents know that they do .__c1
__s.%-__i mean that's what i had before and you told me to list the regions to list them .__c0
__s__and are ==__c1
__s^aap__each - each one has pros and cons .__c3
__b__well i know .__c1
__s.%--__right .__c2
__b__right .__c2
__s__so ==__c0
__s^cs__i mean we - we ==__c3
__s^ba:s^fe__right .__c2
__s__that's true .__c1
__b__yeah | last week - last week i was sort of r- - arguing for having it wide open .__c2
__s^bu.%--__but then everybody said oh no .__c2
__s^na__but then it will be hard to interpret .__c2
__b__because some people will say cincinnati and some will say ohio .__c2
__s^cs__i mean i had it wide open last week and - and you said timit .__c0
__s^bk__and ==__c2
__s^cs__what if we put in both ?__c3
__b__yeah .__c1
__fg__yeah .__c2
__qy^rt.%--__and - would people ?==__c3
__b__that's what the other is for .__c0
__%--__no | i mean what if we put in both ways of asking them ?__c3
__qy^bu^rt__so one is region .__c3
__fh__and the another one is if you had to characterize yourself - your accent what would you say .__c3
__qrr^rt__won't they answer the same thing ?__c0
__s__well they might only answer only one of the questions .__c3
__qrr.%--__but if ==__c3
__s__yeah that's fine .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__you know .__c3
__s^bk__they might say other for region because they don't know what category to use .__c1
__s__actually ==__c3
__s__but they might have something ==__c1
__s__right .__c3
__s__it just - and we ==__c3
__b__because it is easier to have it open ended .__c1
__b__we might learn from what they say as to which one's a better way to ask it .__c3
__qy^d^f^g^rt__but - i - because i really don't know .__c3
__s.%--__w- - this is just a small thing .__c2
__s^aa__@reject@ .__c3
__b__but um it says variety and then it gives things that e- - have american as one of the choices .__c2
__s.%--__but then it says region .__c2
__s:s__but region actually just applies to uh u s .__c2
__s__right ?__c2
__s^df__right .__c0
__b__i mean that's why i put the other in .__c0
__s__well we thought about it .__c1
__s__uh okay .__c2
__b__yeah okay .__c1
__s^ba__s- ==__c2
__fg|s^ba__we just - we sort of thought yes - y- - y- - i mean ==__c1
__s^ba__at the last meeting my recollection was that we felt people would have uh less ==__c1
__b__that - that there are so many types and varieties of these other languages .__c1
__b__and we are not going to have that many subjects from these different language groups .__c1
__b__and that it's a huge waste of - of space .__c1
__s__yep .__c0
__s^ba^r__okay .__c2
__s.%--__so i mean i - i mean the way i had it last time was region was blank .__c0
__b__that's what i thought .__c1
__s__it just said region colon .__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^df__and - and i think that that's the best way to do it .__c0
__b__because - because of the problems we're talking about .__c0
__s^ba__but what we said last week was no put in a list .__c0
__fh__so i put in a list .__c0
__s^rt^tc__maybe we can make the list a little smaller .__c3
__b__so should we go back to ?==__c0
__fh__well certainly dropping northern i think is right because none of us know what that is .__c0
__b__because i mean ==__c3
__s__and keeping other .__c3
__s^rt__and then maybe this north midland we call it north midwest .__c3
__s:s^co__south midwest or just ?==__c3
__b__yes i - i - i think so yeah .__c2
__s__south midwest .__c3
__s__does that make sense ?__c3
__b__south midwest ?__c4
__s__that would help me ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^bu__because ==__c3
__s.%-__u- - unless you're from midland kansas .__c2
__s__midland ==__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__but ==__c2
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^2.%-__i don't know where midland is .__c3
__s__there's a - or midland - midland ==__c2
__fh__is it midland - midland - midland texas or midland kansas ?__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__is midwest one word ?__c0
__s^aap|s^rt__y- - yeah one w- ==__c3
__s__i forget .__c2
__b__but there's a town .__c2
__s^f__oh .__c3
__b__in - in there .__c2
__s^rt__i forget what it is @reject@ .__c2
__s.%--__i don't think that's what they mean .__c1
__s^bd__but ==__c3
__s^rt__yeah | so kansas would be south midland .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__right ?__c3
__s__y- - yeah .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__and - and wouldn't ?==__c3
__s^ba__yeah .__c3
__s.%-__so th- - i'm from kansas actually .__c3
__s^m^na__and colorado right across the border would be north midland .__c2
__s^am__southern midland .__c4
__s^rt__@reject@ .__c4
__%-__yeah .__c3
__s^bd__colora- ==__c3
__s^df__and uh ==__c0
__fh__oh right .__c3
__s^ng__and then the - the - dropping north ==__c3
__b__so it would be western .__c3
__b__it's just one big shebang where of course you have huge variation in dialects .__c3
__s__but you do in the others too so ==__c2
__b__but that's true of new england too .__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__but - but so do you ==__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^df__so i mean only one ==__c0
__fg|s^cs__yeah .__c2
__s^ba__yeah yeah .__c3
__s^df__well i shouldn't say that .__c0
__s^aa__i have no clue .__c0
__b__i was going to say the only one that doesn't have a huge variety is new york city .__c0
__s^e__but i have no idea whether it does or not .__c0
__b__it does seem ==__c1
__s.%-__u- ==__c2
__qy^rt__i mean i - i would think that these categories would be more - w- - would be easier for an an- - analyst to put in rather than the subject himself .__c1
__fh__i think that - that was what happened with timit was that it was an analyst .__c0
__s__okay .__c1
__s__wait a minute .__c2
__s__where does - where does - d- - w- - where - where's - where does uh new - new york west of - west of uh new york city and pennsylvania uh and uh ?==__c2
__s.%--__yeah | i don't know how it came from .__c3
__s__okay .__c1
__s__so that's new england i think .__c3
__b__new england .__c0
__b__n- - no it's not !__c2
__s__yeah .__c3
__fg__oh no !__c0
__fh|s.%-__oh no .__c2
__s^cs__i sort of thought they were part of the - one of the midlands .__c1
__fg__no no no .__c2
__s__pennsylvania is not ==__c2
__s^aa__other .__c0
__b__it goes under other .__c0
__%-__definitely under other .__c0
__s.%-__well you know pennsylvania has a pretty strong dialect and it's totally different than ==__c3
__s__pennsylvania ==__c2
__s^aa^rt__yeah | pennsylvania is not new england .__c2
__s^cs^rt__and uh new jersey is not new england and maryland is not new england and none of those are the south .__c2
__s^bk|s^co^j__okay so ==__c0
__b__another suggestion .__c0
__s^cs^rt__yeah .__c1
__s^bd__rather than have circle fill in forms say region open paren e g southern comma western comma close paren colon .__c0
__s__okay .__c1
__s^ba^na__okay .__c3
__s__that's good .__c2
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__fine by me fine by me .__c1
__s__sure .__c3
__s__i like that .__c2
__s__yeah .__c1
__fh__let's just ==__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__%-__and we'll see what we get .__c3
__s__we're all sufficiently tired of this that we're agreeing with you .__c2
__s.%-__be easier on the subjects .__c1
__s^ba|s.%--__i think that's fine .__c1
__b__so ==__c2
__s__no .__c1
__s__i think ==__c1
__s^cs__i like that i like that .__c1
__b__you like it ?__c2
__%--__okay .__c2
__s^cs__yeah i do .__c1
__fh__good .__c2
__s^ba__actually maybe we do one non english one as well .__c0
__b__southern cockney ?__c0
__s^ba__yeah and ==__c3
__b^rt__yeah .__c4
__s^t^tc__is that a real accent ?__c0
__s^ba__sure yeah .__c1
__fh|s__yeah .__c4
__s__how do you spell it ?__c0
__qy.%--__i think that's fine .__c1
__s__cockney ?__c2
__qy__c o ==__c2
__s__n e y ?__c0
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__you could say liverpool .__c3
__s.%--__liverpuddlian .__c2
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__actually liverpool doesn't l- ==__c3
__b__all right .__c1
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__s^bk|s^bk^m__it's - i'm s- - i ha- ==__c3
__s^bk__well well i mean pure ==__c1
__s^aa|%-__okay we'll do it that way .__c0
__s^df__actually i like that a lot .__c0
__s^ar__okay .__c2
__s.%-__because that get's at both of the things we were trying to do .__c0
__s__the granularity and the person can just self assess and we don't have to argue about what these regions are .__c0
__s.%--__that's right .__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__okay .__c2
__fg.%__and it's easy on the subjects .__c1
__s__yep .__c0
__s__now i have one suggestion on the next section .__c1
__%-__uhhuh .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__s^bk__so you have native language .__c1
__%-__you have region .__c1
__b__and then you have time spent in english speaking country .__c1
__s^bk__now i wonder if it might be useful to have another open field saying which one parenthesis s paren- - closed parenthesis .__c1
__s^aa__because if they spent time in - in britain and america ==__c1
__fg|s__yes .__c2
__s__it doesn't have to be ex- - all - at all exact just in the same open field format that you have .__c1
__fh__yep just which one .__c0
__fg|s^rt__i think that's fine .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s^bk^rt__with a - with an s .__c1
__s^bd__which one .__c1
__qy^rt__sss - optional s .__c1
__qrr.%--__okay .__c2
__s__huh .__c4
__s__yeah .__c1
__qy^rt__we uh - we done ?__c2
__qrr.%--__yep .__c0
__h|qw^t1__yeah that's good .__c1
__%-__okay .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__um | s- - e- - any - any other uh open mike topics or should we go right to the digits ?__c2
__s^aa__um | did you guys get my email on the multitrans ?__c0
__b__that ==__c0
__s__okay .__c0
__s__isn't that wonderful ?__c1
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__excellent !__c1
__s^df__yeah so so | i - i have a version also which actually displays all the channels .__c0
__b__thank you .__c1
__b__it's really great .__c3
__s^cs.%-__but it's hideously slow .__c0
__s__so you - this is n- - dan's patches dan ellis's patches .__c1
__s__the - what - the ones i applied that you can actually do are dan's because it doesn't slow it down .__c0
__fh__m- ==__c3
__s^bk__fantastic !__c1
__s__just uses a lot of memory .__c0
__s.%--__so when you say slow does that mean to ?==__c3
__fg|s^cs__no the - the one that's installed is fine .__c0
__s^bd^df__it's not slow at all .__c0
__s^cs__i wrote another version which instead of having the one pane with the one view it has multiple panes with the views .__c0
__s^e^rt__yeah .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^ba__but the problem with it is the drawing of those waveforms is so slow that every time you do anything it just crawls .__c0
__s:s__uhhuh .__c1
__qy^d^rt__it's really bad .__c0
__s^nd.%-__it's - so it - it's the redrawing of the w- ==__c3
__s^nd.%-__that's a consideration .__c1
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c0
__fh__oh uhhuh .__c3
__fg__w- - as you move .__c3
__s^aa__as you play as you move as you scroll .__c0
__s^j__just about anything and it - it was so slow it was not usable .__c0
__fg__and this'll be a - hav- - having the multiwave will be a big help .__c1
__b__so that's why i didn't install it and didn't pursue it .__c0
__s^aa__because - in terms of like disentangling overlaps and things that'll be a big help .__c1
__b__oh yeah .__c3
__b__so | i think that the one dan has is usable enough .__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s^cs^nd__it doesn't display the others .__c0
__b__it displays just the mixed signal .__c0
__fg__uhhuh .__c1
__s.%--__but you can listen to any of them .__c0
__s^m__that's excellent .__c1
__s^2^j__yeah .__c4
__b__he also has version control which is another nice ==__c1
__b__e- - so you - e- - the patches that you ==__c1
__b__no | he suggested that but he didn't - it's not installed .__c0
__%-__oh i thought it was in one of those patches .__c1
__s^aa__no no .__c0
__s__oh okay .__c1
__s^ba^cs__well all right .__c1
__s__so is there any hope for actually displaying the wave form ?__c3
__s^cc__um not if we're going to use tcl t. k. at least not if we're going to use snack .__c0
__s__okay .__c3
__s__i mean you would have to do something ourselves .__c0
__s^ar|%-__well or use the one that crawls .__c1
__s^ng.%-__okay .__c3
__fh__well i'm - i probably would be trying to use the - whatever's there .__c3
__s^bk__and it's useful to have the ==__c3
__s^2__why don't we - we see how dan's works and if it - if we really need the display ==__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__i mean i wonder - i'm just wondering if we can display things other than the wave form .__c3
__s__so suppose we have a feature - a feature stream .__c3
__fg__and it's just you know a - a uni dimensional feature varying in time .__c3
__s^t__yeah .__c4
__s__and we want to plot that instead of the whole wave form .__c3
__s^df__i mean ==__c0
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__that might be faster .__c3
__s^cc__right ?__c3
__s^df__yeah .__c4
__s^df^e__so ==__c3
__qy^bu^rt__we - we could do that but that would mean changing the code .__c0
__s^2__i mean this isn't a program we wrote .__c0
__fg__yeah .__c2
__s^na__this is a program that we got from someone else and we've done patches on .__c0
__s^na__okay .__c3
__s^j__okay well i'll talk to you about it and we can see .__c3
__s^na__uhhuh .__c1
__s^e__yeah .__c4
__fh__cou- - i- - e- - i mean y- ==__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__so ==__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c0
__qy^d^j^rt__but it's definitely great to have the other one .__c3
__qw^rt__that's ==__c3
__s^na__if there was some - is there some way to have someone write patches in something faster and - and - link it in or something .__c2
__s^fe__or is that ?==__c2
__s^fe__not easily .__c0
__s^nd.%-__i mean y- - yes we could do that .__c0
__s__you could - you can write widgets in c .__c0
__s^bc__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__and try to do it that way but i just don't think - it ==__c0
__s^na__let's try it with dan's and if that isn't enough we can do it otherwise .__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__right .__c3
__qh__i think it is | because when i was playing with it the mixed signal has it all in there .__c0
__qw__and so it's really - it's not too bad to find places in the - in the stream where things are happening .__c0
__s.%-__okay .__c3
__s.%-__and it's also - also the case that - that uh this multi wave thing is proposed to the ==__c1
__%-__huh .__c4
__s.%-__so i - i don't think it'll be bad .__c0
__s.%--__so dan proposed it to the transcriber central people .__c1
__s__and it's likely that uh ==__c1
__s^e__so and - and they responded favorably .__c1
__s^e__looks as though it will be incorporated in the future version .__c1
__fh__oh .__c3
__fh|s__they said that the only reason they hadn't had the multi - the parallel uh stream one before was simply that they hadn't had time to do it .__c1
__s__and uh | so it's likely that this - this may be entered into the ch- - this central @reject@ .__c1
__s^ba__yeah .__c4
__%--__they may well have not had much demand for it .__c2
__s^bk__and if - if ==__c0
__s__well that's - that's - that's true too .__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__this is a - a useful thing for us .__c1
__s__so you mean they could - they could do it and it would be fast enough if they do it ?__c3
__s^j.%--__yeah .__c4
__s.%--__oh no | i just mean - i just mean that it's - that - that his ==__c1
__s__depends on how much work they did .__c0
__s__or ?==__c3
__s^bk__oh .__c4
__b__so this one that we now have does have the status of potentially being incorporated l- - likely being incorporated into the central code .__c1
__s.%-__uhhuh .__c3
__s__okay .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__now tha- - now if we develop further then y- - uh i don't ==__c1
__s^e.%--__i mean it's - i think it's a nice feature to have it - set that way .__c1
__s^am__i think if - if - if one of us sat down and coded it so that it could be displayed fast enough i'm sure they would be quite willing to incorporate it .__c0
__s^am__uhhuh .__c1
__s^am__but it's not a trivial task .__c0
__s^aa__okay .__c3
__s^am__uhhuh yeah .__c1
__b__i just like the idea of it being something that's you know tied back into the original so that other people can benefit from it .__c1
__s^aa^r__yeah .__c0
__b__yeah .__c1
__s.%--__however i also understand that you can have widgets that are very useful for their purpose and that you don't need to always go that w- - route .__c1
__s^e__yeah .__c1
__b__okay .__c4
__s^e__anyway | shall we do digits ?__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__yeah | let's do digits .__c2
__fh__uh and then we'll turn off the mikes and then i have one other thing to discuss .__c2
__s__okay .__c1
__b__i actually have to leave .__c3
__b__okay .__c0
__b__so um i mean i had to leave at three thirty .__c3
__fh|qw^cs__so i can - well i can wait for the digits but i can't stay for the discussion .__c3
__s^e__uh oh !__c1
__s^aa|s.%--__oh .__c2
__s.%-__okay .__c0
__s^2__well you want to go first or ?==__c0
__s^cs^rt__i c- - i have to make a call .__c3
__s^ba.%__so ==__c3
__fh|s^t__okay .__c2
__s^j__well we'll talk to you about it - uh ==__c2
__s^j^r__well should we - e- - should we switch off the g- ?==__c1
__s^cs__um ==__c3
__s^aa__do you want to go do digits or do you want to just skip digits ?__c0
__s.%-__no i can do digits if - if - but i don't want to butt in or something .__c3
__s^aa|s^cs.%-__then all right | you go ahead .__c0
__s^m__but if there's something on the rest of the ==__c3
__s^cs^j.%-__i'm - i'll be around just have to make call before quarter of .__c3
__s__so ==__c3
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c4
__%-__so i ==__c3
__%--__or we can talk about it .__c3
__s^cs^j__ke- ==__c1
__s^bk^j__why don't you read the digits ?__c0
__%-__okay all right .__c3
__s__yeah why don't you read the digits and then you can go .__c2
__s^j.%__oh this is the new one .__c3
__s^df__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__yeah | don't - don't read the old one .__c0
__s__all right .__c3
__fh__the - and the time is ==__c3
