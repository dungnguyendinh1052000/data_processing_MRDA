__z__yeah .__c4
__z__um - so ==__c1
__z__if we can't we can't but uh we're going to try to make this an abbreviated meeting .__c1
__z__because the - the next - next occupants were pushing for it .__c1
__z__so ==__c1
__z__um .__c1
__z__so ==__c1
__z__agenda is - according to this is transcription status darpa demos x m l tools disks backups et cetera and crosspads .__c1
__z__does anyone have anything to add to the agenda ?__ca
__z__okay .__c1
__z__should we just go in order ?__c1
__z__transcription status .__c1
__z__who's - that's probably you .__c1
__z__i can do that quickly .__c0
__z__um i hired several more transcribers .__c0
__z__they're making great progress .__c0
__z__seven ?__c1
__z__seve- - several several .__c0
__z__oh .__c1
__z__and uh ==__c0
__z__and uh ==__c0
__z__uh i've been uh finishing up the uh double checking .__c0
__z__i hoped to have had that done by today .__c0
__z__but it's going to take one more week .__c0
__z__um ==__ca
__z__as a somewhat segue into the next topic um - could i get a hold of uh - the data even if it's not really corrected yet ?__ca
__z__i g- ==__c3
__z__just so i can get the data formats .__ca
____and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working .__ca
__z__certainly .__c0
__z__yeah i mean it's in the same place it's been .__c0
__z__so can you just ?==__ca
____oh it is ?__ca
____okay .__ca
__s^bk|s^t^tc__uhhuh no change .__c0
__s^tc__just - so transcripts is the sub directory ?__ca
__s^bk__uh | yes uhhuh .__c0
__s.%--__okay .__ca
__s__so i'll - i'll probably just make some copies of those .__ca
__s__rather than use the ones that are there .__ca
__s__okay .__c0
__s^m__um | and then just - we'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made .__ca
__s__okay .__c0
__s^bk__okay | wh- ==__c1
__s__i also got anot- - a short remark to the transcription .__c3
__b__i've uh just processed the first five e d u meetings .__c3
__s^bu__and they are chunked up .__c3
__s^aa__so they would - they probably can be sent to i b m .__c3
__b__whenever they want them .__c3
__qy^d^g__well the second one of those ==__c5
__s^bk__cool .__c2
__qy^rt__yep | it's already at i b m .__c3
__s^rt__is already at i b m .__c5
__s^rt__but the other ones ==__c3
__s^rt__that's the one that we're waiting to hear from them on .__c5
__s^rt__yeah .__c3
__s^rt__yeah .__c3
__s^rt__yeah .__c5
__s^rt__okay .__c0
__s__these are separate from the ones that ==__c0
__s^rt__as soon as ==__c5
__s^rt__i mean these are ==__c0
__%--__they're the i b m set .__c5
__b__it's this one .__ca
__s__yep .__c3
__s^rt__excellent .__c0
__s^rt__yeah .__c5
__s__good .__c0
__s^bsc.%--__is my mike on ?__ca
__s^rt__and so as soon as we hear from brian that this one is okay .__c5
__s^df^rt__yeah .__ca
__b__and we get the transcript back .__c5
__s__and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them .__c5
__s^df__then uh we'll be ready to go and we'll just send them the next four as a big batch .__c5
__s^bk|sj^ba__excellent .__c0
__qy^rt__and let them work on that .__c5
__s^aa__and so we're doing those as disjoint from the ones we're transcribing here ?__ca
__sj^ba^df__yes .__c5
__s^bk^rt__okay good .__ca
__sj^bu__exactly .__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__we're sort of doing things in parallel .__c5
__s^aa__that way we can get as much done a- - at once .__c5
__s^bk__yeah i think that's the right way to do it .__ca
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__sj^ba__especially for the information retrieval stuff .__ca
__fh__anything else on transcription status ?__ca
__s__hm-huh .__c0
__s__okay .__ca
__s^rt__darpa demos .__c1
__s__we had the submeeting the other day .__c1
__s__right | which uh ==__ca
__s__so i've been working on using the thisl tools to do information retrieval on meeting data .__ca
__s^bk|sj^ba^rt__and the thisl tools are - there're two sets there's a back end and a front end .__ca
__s__so the front end is the user interface .__ca
__b__and the back end is the indexing tool and the querying tool .__ca
__s__and so i've written some tools to convert everything into the right for- - file formats .__ca
__s__and the command line version of the indexing and the querying is now working .__ca
__b__so at least on the one meeting that i had the transcript for - uh conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it .__ca
__b__do - type in a - a string and get back a list of start end times for the meeting .__ca
__b__uh of hits .__ca
__qy^rt__what - what kind of uh - what does that look like the string that you type in ?__c5
__s^aa__what are you - are you - are they keywords or are they ?==__c5
__s__keywords .__ca
__s^bk|qy^rt__okay .__c5
__s^bk__i see .__c5
__b__right and so - and then it munges it to pass it to the thisl i r which uses an s g m l like format for everything .__ca
__s^tc.%--__i see .__c5
__s__and then - does it play something back ?__c1
__s^cs__or that's something you're having to program ?__c1
__b__um right now i have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools .__ca
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__s^no__but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either ==__ca
__qy^rt__so - so that's the other thing i wanted to discuss is well what should we do for the user interface .__ca
__s^cs__we have two tools that have already been written .__ca
__b__um | the softsound guys did a web based one .__ca
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__b__um | which i haven't used haven't looked at .__ca
__qw__dan says it's pretty good .__ca
__h|s__uhhuh .__c1
__b.%__but it does mean you need to be running a web server .__ca
__fh__uhhuh .__c1
__s^bk__and so it - it's pretty big and complex .__ca
__s__uh | and it would be difficult to port to windows .__ca
__fh__because it means porting the web server to windows .__ca
__fg__uhhuh .__c1
__s^cc__uh the other option is dan did the tcl t k thisl gui front end for broadcast news .__ca
__b^rt__yeah .__c1
__s^e__which i think looks great .__ca
__s^bk__i think that's a nice demo .__ca
__fh__um and that would be much easier to port to windows .__ca
__qy^rt__and so i think that's the way we should go .__ca
__s^df__i - can i ask a question ?__c0
__s^aa__uhhuh .__ca
__h|s__so um | as it stands within the - the channeltrans interface it's possible to do a find and a play .__c0
__s^cs__you can find a searched string and play .__c0
__s^e__so e- - are you - so you're adding like um - i don't know uh are they fuzzy matches or are they uh ?==__c0
__qy^cs^d^rt__it's a sort of standard text-retrieval-based .__ca
__qo^rt__so it's uh term frequency inverse document frequency scoring .__ca
__s^bk^rt__okay .__c0
__qw__um | and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing .__ca
__h|s.%-__how far apart they have to be and things like that .__ca
__qy^d^rt__so it - it's ==__ca
__qy^d^g^rt__it's a lot more sophisticated than the uh - the basically windows based .__c0
__h|s__i- - it's like doing a google query or anyth- - anything else like that .__ca
__qy^cs^d^rt__so i- - it uses - so it pr- - produces an index ahead of time .__ca
__s^aa__okay .__c0
__qy^d^r^rt__so you don't - you're not doing a linear search through all the documents .__ca
__s^rt__because you can imagine if - with - if we have the sixty hours' worth you do - wouldn't want to do a search .__ca
__s^bk__hm-huh .__c0
__s__um you have to do preindexing .__ca
__b__good .__c0
__b__and so that - these tools do all that .__ca
__qy^bu^d^rt__and so the work to get the front end to work would be porting it ==__ca
__qw^br__well | uh to get it to work on the unix systems our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings .__ca
__qy^bu^d^r^rt__so that it understands that they're different speakers and that it's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sort of things like that .__ca
__s^bk.%__uhhuh .__c1
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c1
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c9
__s^ng__so what does the user see as the result of the query ?__c5
__s^bk__on which tool ?__ca
__s__thisl .__c5
__s__the thisl gui tool which is the one that dan wrote tcl t k .__ca
__s__yeah .__c5
__s^bk__um | you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits .__ca
__s^cs__and you can type on them and listen to them .__ca
__sj^ba__click on them rather with a mouse .__ca
__fg__uh .__c5
__s.%--__so if you typed in small heads or something you could ?==__c5
__h__huh .__c1
__s__right | you'd get ==__ca
__s^bd__get back a uh uh - something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred .__c5
__fh|s.x__something ==__ca
__s.%--__you - you'd get to listen to beep .__ca
__s^bk__or some- ==__c5
__s__that was a really good look .__c1
__b^rt__it's too bad that that couldn't come into the ==__c1
__s^rt__you couldn't get a video .__ca
__b__guess who i practice on .__c9
__s__at some point we're going to have to say what that private joke is .__c0
__s__that keeps coming up .__c0
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__and then again maybe not .__c1
__s__so uh ==__c1
__s__yeah that soun- - that sounds reasonable .__c1
__b__yeah it loo- - it - my - my recollection of it is it's - it's a pretty reasonable - uh demo sort of format .__c1
__s__right .__ca
__s:qw__yeah that sounds good .__c5
__s^f__and so i think there'd be minimal effort to get it to work minimally .__ca
__b__that sounds really neat .__c5
__s__and then we'd want to add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff .__ca
__b__um dave gelbart expressed some interest in working on that .__ca
__b__so i'll work with him on it .__ca
__qh__and it - it's looking pretty good .__ca
__s__you know the fact that i got the query system working .__ca
__b__so if we want to just do a video based one i think that'll be easy .__ca
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s__if we want to get it to windows it's going to be a little more work .__ca
__s__because the thisl i r - the information retrieval tool's - um ==__ca
__s.%--__i had difficulty just compiling them on solaris .__ca
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s.%--__so getting them to compile on windows might be challenging .__ca
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s__but you were saying that - that the uh - that there's that set of tools uh cygnus tools that ==__c5
__s__so ==__ca
__s__it certainly helps .__ca
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s^rt__um i mean without those i wouldn't even attempt it .__ca
__s__yeah .__c5
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c1
__b__but what those - they - what those do is provide sort of a b s d compatibility layer .__ca
__s^rt__so that the normal unix function calls all work .__ca
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__sj^df__uhhuh .__c1
__s__um ==__ca
__b__and you have to have all the o- ==__c5
__b__but the problem is that - that the thisl tools didn't use anything like autoconf .__ca
__b__and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and th- - some things are defined and some things aren't .__ca
__s.%--__and uh - different compiler work arounds and so on .__ca
__s__so the fact that - um it took me a day to get it c- - to compile under solaris means it's probably going to take me s- - significantly more than that to get it to compile under windows .__ca
__qy__how about having it run under free b s d ?__c1
__qy^rt__well what you need ==__c4
__qy^d^rt__free b s d would probably be easier .__ca
__qw__all you need to do is say to dan gee it would be nice if this worked under autoconf and it'll be done in a day .__c4
__qy__that's true .__ca
__qy^d^rt__right ?__c4
__s__uh ==__c3
__s__actually you know i should check .__ca
__s__because he did port it to sprachcore .__ca
__s__right .__c4
__s.%--__so he might have done that already .__ca
__s__i - i - i wouldn't be surprised .__c4
__s__so ==__c1
__s^e__i'll check at that .__ca
__fh|s__how does it play ?__c5
__s__what i ==__c4
__s__but it would - what would serve - would serve both purposes is if you contact him and ask him if he's already done it .__c1
__s__yeah right .__ca
__s__if he has then you learn .__c1
__s__if he hasn't then he'll do it .__c1
__s__right .__ca
__s__wow .__c0
__s^rt__i hope he never listens to these meetings .__c5
__s__that's right .__ca
__s.%--__so | and i've been corresponding with dan and also with uh - uh - softsound guy uh ==__ca
__s__it's amazing .__c0
__b__yeah .__c1
__b__blanking on his name .__ca
__sj__tony robinson ?__c5
__s__tony robinson ?__c1
__qw.%__do i mean tony ?__ca
__s__i guess i do .__ca
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__or s- - or steve renals .__ca
__s.x__james christie .__c4
__s__which one do i mean ?__ca
__fh__steve renal- - steve renals .__c1
__qh__steve renals is not softsound .__c4
__s^fe__is he ?__c4
__%-__no .__c1
__qh__my brain is not working .__ca
__s.%-__i don't remember who i've been corresponding with .__ca
__s^ar__okay .__c1
__sj^cs__steve wro- - i- - it's ste- - steve renals wrote thisl i r .__c4
__s__then it's steve renals .__ca
__qh^cs.%--__okay .__c4
__s__oh okay .__c1
__b.x__so uh just getting documentation and uh and f- - and formats .__ca
__qw^rt__yeah .__c1
__h|s.x__so that's all going pretty well .__ca
__s.%-__i think we'll be okay with that .__ca
__b.x__right .__c4
__s^bk.x__assuming we're ==__c1
__s.%--__what about issues of playing sound files between the two platforms ?__c5
__sj^ba__um ==__ca
__s^bk__we have ==__ca
__b__well that's a good point too .__ca
__s__here's a - here's a crazy idea actually .__c4
__s.%--__i don't know .__ca
__s^2__why don't you try and merge transcriber and thisl i r ?__c4
__b__well this is one of the reasons ==__ca
__s^bk__they're both tcl interfaces .__c4
__s^bc__this is the - one of the reasons that i'm going to have uh dave gelbart - gelbart .__ca
__b__having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing .__ca
__b__because he's worked on the transcriber stuff .__ca
__s^bk__right .__c4
__b__and he's more familiar with tcl t k than i am .__ca
__b__and then you get - they - then you get the windows media playing for free .__c4
__b__well - that's snack not - not transcriber .__ca
__s__right | but the point is that the transcriber uses snack and then you can - but you can use a - a lot of the same functionality .__c4
__s__yeah yeah | i mean i - i think thisl - thisl gui probably uses snack .__ca
__b__and it's ==__c4
__b__and so my intention was just to base it on that .__ca
__s^cs__yeah .__c4
__s__well my thought was is that it would be nice - it would be nice to have the running transcripts - um uh you know from speaker to speaker .__c4
__b__and if it doesn't ==__ca
__%-__right ?__c4
__%--__do you have - you have you know a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here ?__c4
__%--__right | we'll have to figure out a user interface for that so .__ca
__s^t^tc__right | well that - uh my thought was if you had like multitrans or whatever do it .__c4
__qy.%--__or whatever .__c4
__s^df__yeah .__ca
__s__it might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we'd be talking about .__ca
__b__and having the search tools and so on .__ca
__b__we - we can look into it .__ca
__s__but ==__ca
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__the thing i was asking about with um free b s d is that it might be easier to ==__c1
__b__get powerpoint shows running in free b s d than to get this other package running in ==__c1
__sj^ba__yeah i mean we have to - i have to sit down and try it before i make too many judgments .__ca
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__so uh ==__ca
__b__um ==__ca
__s.%--__my experience with the gnu compatibility library is really - it's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system .__ca
__s.%--__right ?__ca
__s__the windows system isn't any harder .__ca
__s__because it - it looks like a b s d system .__ca
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__b^rt__it's just you know - just like all of them the include files are a little different and the function calls are a little different .__ca
__s__right .__c1
__s__so i - it might be a little easier .__ca
__qh__but it's not going to be a lot easier .__ca
__b__okay .__c1
__s__so there was that demo which was one of the main ones .__c1
__b__and then we talked about - um some other stuff .__c1
__s.%--__which would basically be - um showing off the - the transcriber interface itself .__c1
__s__and as you say maybe we could even merge those in some sense .__c1
__b__but - but um ==__c1
__s__uh - | and part of that was showing off what the speech non - uh nonspeech stuff that thilo has done s- - looks like .__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__qy^d^f__can i ask one more thing about thisl ?__c0
__s__uhhuh .__ca
__s__so with the i r stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized um ?==__c0
__s.%--__uhhuh .__ca
__b__ranked .__ca
__s__excellent .__c0
__s:qy__excellent .__c0
__b^rt__yeah .__c0
__s__so another idea i w- - t- - had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh- - to show some of the prosody - uh work that don's been doing .__c9
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s__um | actually show some of the features .__c9
__b__and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries .__c9
__s__um ==__c9
__s__you know you can show that graphically sort of what the features are doing .__c9
__b__it - you know it doesn't work great but it's definitely giving us something .__c9
__s__well i think it ==__c1
__b__i don't know if that would be of interest or not .__c9
__qy^d^f^g^rt__at the very least we're going to want something illustrative with that .__c1
__b__because i'm going to want to talk about it .__c1
__fh__and so i- - if there's something that shows it graphically it's much better than me just having a bullet point .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c9
__b.%__pointing at something i don't know much about .__c1
__s__i mean you're looking at this now .__c9
__b.%__so ==__c1
__s__are you looking at waves or matlab ?__c9
__b__um | yeah i'm starting to .__c2
__b__and ==__c2
__b__um ==__c2
__b__yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on .__c2
__fg|s__yeah def- ==__c9
__s__s- - so when we here were having this demo meeting what we're sort of coming up with is that we want to have all these pieces together to first order by the end of the month .__c1
__s__i- ==__c9
__b__and then that'll give us a week or so .__c1
__qy^rt__oh the end of this month or next month ?__c9
__s^bu__ooo the end of ==__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__this month .__ca
__s^aap__oh | you mean like today ?__c9
__s__ju- ==__c1
__s^bk^rt__oh .__c9
__b__oh sorry | next month .__ca
__s__june june june .__c1
__s^aa__next month .__c9
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__s__sorry .__c9
__b__today isn't june first .__ca
__s^aa__there's another one .__c5
__s__is it ?__ca
__b__exactly .__c4
__s__uh | that'll - that'll give us - that'll give us a week or so to uh - to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works .__c1
__b__sorry .__c9
__s.%--__i think - i mean uh where ==__c9
__qy^rt__yeah .__c1
__s^bu__yeah | i mean i'll be here .__c2
__s^aa^rt__yeah if d- - if don can sort of talk to whoever's ==__c9
__s.%--__because we're doing this anyway as part of our - you know the research .__c9
__s.%-__yeah .__c1
__s^ar__visualizing what these features are doing .__c9
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__qy^bu.%--__and so either ==__c9
__s__it might not be integrated .__c9
__s^am__but it - it could potentially be in it .__c9
__b__could find some .__c9
__s^aa__yeah well this is to an audience of researchers .__c1
__fh|s__so i mean you know ==__c1
__s^rt__to let s- - the goal is to let them know what it is we're doing .__c1
__s^bk__i mean it's different .__c9
__s^rt__so that's ==__c1
__s^rt__i don't think anyone has done this on meeting data .__c9
__b__so it might be neat you know .__c9
__s^rt__yeah .__c1
__s__good .__c1
__s__done with that .__c1
__fh|s__x m l tools ?__c1
__s^aa__um ==__ca
__s^df__so i've been doing a bunch of x m l tools .__ca
__s__where you - we're sort of moving to x m l as the general format for everything .__ca
__s__and i think that's definitely the right way to go .__ca
__s__because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of x m l tools .__ca
__s__um ==__ca
__fg|s^bk__so yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in x m l .__ca
__fg|s__because i'm not particularly happy with what we have now .__ca
__s^bu__i mean it works with transcriber .__ca
__s^aa__but it - it's a pain to use it in other tools .__ca
__b__uh because it doesn't mark start and end .__ca
__s^aa|s__start and end of each ?==__c5
__s^aa__uh ==__ca
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^m__utterance .__ca
__b.%__utterance .__c5
__fh|s__just marks ?__c5
__s__so it's implicit in - in there .__ca
__s__but you have to do a lot of processing to get it .__ca
__b__yeah .__c5
__s^f__right .__c5
__s__right .__c5
__s.%--__and so - and also i'd like to do the indirect time line business .__ca
__s__um but regardless i mean w- - that's something that you me and jane can talk about later .__ca
__b__um - | but i've installed x m l tools of various sorts in various languages .__ca
__qy^d^f^g^rt__and so if people are interested in doing - extracting any information from any of these files .__ca
__s^aa__either uh information on users because the user database is that way .__ca
__s.%--__i'm converting the key files to x m l so that you can extract m- - uh various inf- - uh sorted information on individual meetings .__ca
__b__cool .__c2
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__and then also the transcripts .__ca
__s.%--__and so l- - just let me know there .__ca
__s__it's mostly java and perl .__ca
__s__but we can get other languages too if - if that's desirable .__ca
__s.%--__oh quick question on that is - do we have the - the seat information ?__c9
__b__in - in the key files now ?__c9
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__s__the seat information is on the key files for the ones which ==__ca
__s^aa.%__uh ==__c0
__s__oh in ==__c9
__s__it's been recorded .__ca
__s.%--__for the new one .__c9
__s__okay .__c9
__b__yeah .__ca
__h|s__seat ?__c1
__s__great .__c9
__b__sea- - yeah .__c9
__b__where - where you're sitting .__ca
__s__oh | not - not the quality or anything no .__c1
__s^aa__n- ==__c3
__s__right .__ca
__fg__okay i see .__c1
__s^no__it's pretty soft and squishy .__ca
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__qy^t3__all right .__c9
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__okay .__c1
__b__oh but that might just be me .__ca
__%-__okay .__c9
__s__um ==__ca
__s^bk__all right .__c9
__s__that's more seat information than we wanted .__c1
__b__never mind .__c9
__fg|s.%--__huh ==__c4
__s.%-__i'm just trying to figure out you know when morgan's voice appears on someone's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him .__c9
__s^bk__maybe we should bleep that out .__ca
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__huh yeah .__c1
__b__wait a minute .__c5
__s^aa__right .__ca
__b__how - how w- - uh where is it in the key file ?__c5
__b.%__yeah .__c1
__h|s.%--__the square bracket .__ca
__%--__because i mean i haven't been putting it in .__c9
__s^cc__and - in by ==__c9
__s__you haven't been putting it in .__ca
__qw.%--__right .__c9
__s__i have not .__c9
__s^bk|s__well bu- ==__c0
__s^bu__oh okay .__ca
__s^aa__isn't it always on the digits ?__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__and ==__c9
__s__some of these are missing .__c1
__s^e__aren't they ?__c1
__x__isn't it always on the digits forms ?__c0
__s^aa|s__some fall out of ==__c1
__s^bk|s.%--__well it- ==__c9
__qo__yeah | so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have .__ca
__qo__ooo .__c2
__qo__i mean they're on th- - right - these .__c9
__s__but i just hadn't ever been putting it in the key files .__c9
__s__yeah i - i never ==__c5
__s__and i don't think chuck was either .__c9
__b__i never knew we were supposed to put it in the key file .__c5
__s.%--__because ==__c9
__s__i had told you guys about it .__ca
__s__oh | so we're both sorry .__c9
__s__but ==__ca
__s^df.%--__oh really ?__c5
__s__so ==__c9
__fg|s^aa__i mean this is why i want to use a g- - a tool to do it rather than the plain text .__ca
__s^aa__okay .__c9
__qy^d^f^g^rt__because with the plain text it's very easy to skip those things .__ca
__s.%--__okay .__c5
__fh__okay .__c9
__s__so ==__ca
__s__um if you use the edit key ==__ca
__b.%__or key edit .__ca
__s^rt.%--__i think it's edit key command .__ca
__s^f^rt__edit key .__c3
__s__did i show you guys that ?__ca
__b__yep .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__i did show it to you .__ca
__s__you mentioned it .__c5
__s__but i think you both said no you'll just use text file .__ca
__s__yeah yeah .__c5
__s__text .__c5
__s^f__um | it has it in there a place to fill it in .__ca
__s__okay .__c9
__s__okay .__c5
__fg.%__yeah and so if you don't fill it in you're not going to get it in the meetings .__ca
__fh__so if ==__c9
__b__so ==__ca
__s.%--__right well i - i just realized i hadn't been doing it .__c9
__s__yep .__ca
__s__and probably - so ==__c9
__s__yeah and then the other thing also that thilo noticed is on the microphone .__ca
__b__u- ==__c2
__s__on channel zero it says hand held mike or crown mike .__ca
__s^aa|s__yeah .__c9
__b__right .__c9
__s^t1__you actually have to say which one .__ca
__s__i know .__c9
__s.%--__yeah i usually delete the ==__c9
__b__so ==__ca
__b__i don't ==__c9
__fh__oh okay | i didn't do that either .__c5
__fg__maybe i forgot to d- ==__c9
__s^rt__yeah .__c3
__s__takes me no time at all to edit these .__c5
__s__but it's almost ==__c9
__b.%__yeah .__c9
__b__yeah that's because you kn- ==__ca
__s__i'm not doing anything .__c5
__s__i - i know why .__ca
__b__and i was - i was looking at chuck's like oh what did chuck do .__c9
__fh__okay i'll do that .__c9
__s^rt.%--__so ==__c9
__s__and then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under participants they were filled in under description .__ca
__b__uh okay .__c1
__s__uh ==__c9
__b__and so that's also a problem .__ca
__b__so anyway .__ca
__s__we will do better .__c9
__qw^br^rt__that's it .__ca
__s__oh uh | also i'm working on another version of this tool .__ca
__qy__the - the one that shows up here that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected .__ca
__s.%-__and it's not quite ready to go yet .__ca
__s__because um it's hard to tell whether the mike's connected or not .__ca
__s^aa__because the best quality ones - the crown ones - are about the same level if they're off .__ca
__s__and no one's o- - off or if they're on and no one's talking .__ca
__fh__huh .__c2
__s__um these - these ones they are much easier .__ca
__s__there's a bigger difference .__ca
__s^aa^rt__so i'm working on that .__ca
__b__and it - it sort of works .__ca
__b__and so eventually we will change to that .__ca
__qw^br__and then you'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out .__ca
__b__will that also include like batteries dying ?__c2
__qw^cs__yep .__ca
__s^df^no__just a- - any time the mike's putting out zeros basically .__c2
__s__yep .__ca
__s^arp__yep .__ca
__s^cc__but with the screensaver kicking in it ==__c5
__s^cc__now ==__ca
__s^df__but ==__c3
__b__y- - yeah .__c3
__fh__well i'll turn off the screensaver too .__ca
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__oops !__c2
__s.%--__um | the other thing is as i've said before it is actually on .__ca
__s^bk__speaking of which .__c2
__s^t.%--__the thing .__ca
__s__there's a little level meter .__ca
__s__but of course no one ever pays attention to it .__ca
__s^bk|s^ar.%--__so i think having it on the screen is more easy to notice .__ca
__s^ng__it would be nice if - if these had little light indicators .__c0
__s^rt__little l e d's for ==__c0
__s^rt__uh buzzer .__ca
__s.%--__yeah a buzzer .__c0
__s__bamp bamp !__ca
__s.%--__small shocks .__c1
__sj^ba__yeah .__c0
__s.%--__actually ==__c0
__s__administered to the ==__c1
__s__okay .__c1
__b__okay disk backup et cetera ?__ca
__fg|s__oh ==__c1
__s^rt__um i spoke with dave johnson about putting all the meeting recorder stuff on non backed up disk to save the overhead of backup .__ca
__b__and he pretty much said yeah you could do that if you want .__ca
__fh|s__but he thought it was a bad idea .__ca
__s^no__in fact what he said is doing the manual one - doing uh n w archive to copy it - is a good idea .__ca
__s__and we should do that and have it backed up .__ca
__b__he w- - he's a firm believer in - in lots of different modalities of backup .__ca
__s__i mean his point was well taken .__ca
__fh__this data cannot be recovered .__ca
__s__yeah .__c9
__s__and so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive .__ca
__s__and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup .__ca
__fg|s.%--__well i guess it is true that even with something that's backed up it's not going to ==__c1
__s^bk^m__if it's stationary it's not going to go through the increment- - it's not going to burden things in the incremental backups .__c1
__qy^rt.%--__just - just the monthly full .__ca
__qw.%-__huh ==__c0
__s^aa|s__yeah | so the monthly full will be a bear .__c1
__b__but ==__c1
__s__yeah but he said that - that we sh- - shouldn't worry too much about that .__ca
__s^bsc__that we're getting a new backup system .__ca
__qy__and we're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it's w- - probably okay .__ca
__s^ar__really ?__c1
__s^ar^r|s__and uh | so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and uh - recording meetings .__ca
__s^bk__so i guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non backed up space for things that took less than twenty four hours to recreate or something like that .__c1
__sj^ba__things that are recreatable easily and also - yeah basically things that are recreatable .__ca
__s^aa|s__right ?__c1
__b.x__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^ar__the expanded files and things like that .__ca
__s^ar^m|s__okay .__c1
__b.x__they take up a lot more room anyway .__ca
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__s__uh but we do need more disk .__ca
__b__so we can get more disk .__c1
__s__yeah .__ca
__b__yeah - so .__c1
__s^aa__and i - i think i agree with him .__ca
__s^aa__i mean his point was well taken that if we lose one of these we cannot get it back .__ca
__qw^br^rt__okay .__c1
__s.%--__i don't think there was any other et cetera there .__ca
__s^r__well i was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had uh ==__c1
__s__i thought you guys were going to burn c d's .__c4
__%-__um | unfortunately - we could burn c d's but first of all it's a pain .__ca
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__because you have to copy it down to the p c and then burn it .__ca
__s__and that's a multi step procedure .__ca
__b__and second of all the - the write once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last .__ca
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__so i think burning them for distribution is fine .__ca
__s__but burning them for backup is not a good idea .__ca
__s__i see .__c4
__s.%--__because th- - they - they fail after a couple years .__ca
__s__okay .__c4
__s__all right .__c4
__s__i do have uh uh - it's a different topic can i add one top- - topic .__c0
__s__we have time ?__c0
__b__i wanted to ask ==__c0
__s__i know that uh that thilo you were um - bringing the channeltrans interface onto the windows machine .__c0
__b__yeah it's - it - basically it's done .__c3
__s__and i wanted to know is th- ==__c0
__s^2.%--__yeah .__c3
__b__it's all done that's g- - wonderful great .__c0
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__yes since tcl t k runs on it basically things will just work .__ca
__s^aap^rt__yeah it ==__c3
__s__yeah it was just a problem with the snack version and the transcriber version .__c3
__sj^ba__but it's solved .__c3
__%-__so ==__c3
__s.%--__does - and that - does that mean i ?==__c0
__s.%--__maybe i should know this but i don't .__c0
__s__does this mean that the - that this could be por- - uh ported to a think pad note- - or some other type of uh ?==__c0
__s__yeah basically uh i did install it on my laptop .__c3
__s:s__and - yeah .__c3
__b^rt__wonderful .__c0
__s__it worked .__c3
__s^bk^rt__wonderful .__c0
__s^bk__huh !__c1
__s.%-__good .__c1
__s^bk__crosspads ?__c1
__fg|s__uh i got an email from uh - james landay .__ca
__fg|%-__who basically said if you're not using them could you return them .__ca
__s^bk__so he said he doesn't need them he just periodically w- - at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them .__ca
__s^bk__and asks them if they're still using them .__ca
__s__so we've never used them .__c1
__s__we used them once .__c0
__qy.%--__we - we used them a couple times .__ca
__s__once ?__c1
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c0
__s__them ?__c5
__s__but ==__ca
__b__couple times .__c0
__s.%-__there's more than one ?__c5
__fg|s__yeah | we have two .__ca
__b__yeah .__c0
__s__i- ==__c1
__s^rt__um ==__ca
__b__but ==__c1
__s__my opinion on it is ==__ca
__s__first i never take notes anyway .__ca
__s__so i'm not going to use it .__ca
__b__um | and second it's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with .__ca
__s__and i have - uh so my - my feeling on it is that i think in principle it's a really nice idea .__c0
__b__and you have the time tags which makes it better tha- - than just taking ra- - raw notes .__c0
__b__on the other hand i - the down side for me was that i think the pen is really noisy .__c0
__s.%--__so you have ka- - kaplunk kaplunk kaplunk .__c0
__s__and i - and i don't know if it's audible on the ==__c0
__s__but i - i sort of thought that was a disadvantage .__c0
__b__i do take notes .__c0
__s^rt__i mean i could be taking notes on these things .__c0
__s^rt__and i guess the plus with the crosspads would be the time markings .__c0
__fh|s.%--__but ==__c0
__qo__i don't know .__c0
__s^rt__uh | what is a crosspad ?__c3
__s__so it's - it's um - it's a regular pad just a regular pad of paper but there's this pen which indicates position .__c1
__fh|qo__thank you .__c2
__b__and so you have time and position stuff stored .__c1
__s^rt__okay .__c3
__fg__so that you can - you have a record of whatever it is you've written .__c1
__qy.%--__okay .__c3
__s^rt__and then you can download it .__ca
__s__and they have o c r and searching and all sorts of things .__ca
__b__okay .__c3
__qw.%--__okay .__c3
__s.%--__so i- - if you take notes it's a great little device .__ca
__s.%--__could - uhhuh ==__c0
__fg__but i don't take notes .__ca
__s.%--__and one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in - in higher level things .__c1
__fg|s__so ==__ca
__s^aa__not just the you know microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth .__c1
__s__and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa- - what was it that happened in the meeting - you know where would it come from .__c1
__qw__and um | i think that was one of the things .__c1
__h|s^rt__yeah .__c3
__s^rt__yep .__ca
__s^rt__yeah .__c9
__s__right ?__c1
__s.%-__and so the - it seemed like a neat idea .__c1
__fh__we'll have a - you know have a scribe .__c1
__s^bu.%--__have somebody uh take good notes and then that's part of the record of the meeting .__c1
__b__and then we did it once or twice and we sort of ==__c1
__qy^rt__yep | and then just sort of died out .__ca
__qy.%--__probably chose the wrong scribe .__c1
__qy.%--__but it was - it's uh ==__c1
__qy^rt__yeah that's right .__ca
__qrr^rt__i mean ==__c9
__s^ar|s.%--__well i did it one time .__c0
__s__but um ==__c0
__fg__yep .__ca
__s.%-__yeah .__c1
__s^bk|s^bu__u- - but i guess the - the other thing i'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing i wonder if we'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe .__c0
__s^bk^r__by listening to the tape - to the recording afterwards .__c0
__b__and taking notes in some other interface .__c0
__s^aa__i mean we're transcribing it anyways .__c5
__s__why do we need notes ?__c5
__s^bk__oh it's la- - it's useful .__c0
__%-__because that's summary .__ca
__s__have a summary and high points .__c0
__s.%-__i think ==__c9
__fg__summary .__c1
__s__there's also ==__c9
__s__there's this use that ==__c9
__qy^d^rt__summarize it from the transcription .__c5
__s^df__the ==__c9
__s^df^no__well what if you're sitting there and you just want to make an x ?__c9
__s^bk|s__and you don't want to take notes .__c9
__s.%--__and you're - you just want to ==__c9
__s^bk__doodle .__c5
__qo__get the summary of the transcript from this time location .__c9
__b__like - you know and - and then while you're bored you don't do anything .__c9
__s__and once in a while maybe there's a joke and you put a x .__c9
__fh__but ==__c9
__s__in - in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way .__c9
__b__also with - i was thinking - and i know morgan disagrees with me on this .__c9
__s__but - suppose you have a group in here and you want to let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not want to distribute in terms of content .__c9
__%--__they could just sort of make an x near that point .__c9
__s^bk__or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c- - could get some red flags in that transcript region .__c9
__fg|s__and they can then look at it .__c9
__s.%--__so ==__c9
__s__i know we haven't been using it .__c9
__s__but i w- - i can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods .__c9
__s__right .__ca
__s.%--__which you then get back in a transcript .__c9
__qy^d^rt__well .__c0
__s.%--__i guess - so w- - you know what - what makes one think i- - is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later .__c1
__s__so ==__c9
__s^bk|s^no__and - and - and put some kind of summary or something .__c1
__qy__uh | you know some - there'd be some scribe who would actually listen w- - who'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing .__c1
__s__not transcribe it but just sort of write down things that struck them as important .__c1
__%-__but then you don't - you don't have the time reference - uh that you'd have if you had it live .__c1
__s__right .__c9
__s^bk__and you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful .__c9
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__how do you synchronize the time in the crosspad and the time of the recording ?__c5
__%-__so ==__c9
__s.%--__i mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally .__ca
__s__and that- - that's w- - part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time - the crosspads .__ca
__s^aa__and so that means synchronizing the time ==__ca
__s__oh .__c9
__fg|%-__you know you want it pretty close .__ca
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__b__and there's a fair amount of skew because it's a hand held unit with a battery .__ca
__b__well | when - when i d- ==__c0
__b__and so you ==__ca
__fg|s__okay .__c0
__fh__so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used .__ca
__s__so that it's synchronized with the time on that .__ca
__s^aa__and then you have to download to an application .__ca
__b__and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you want to do anything with this information .__ca
__b__and so there's a lot of infrastructure which ==__ca
__s__w- - uhhuh .__c0
__s__why ?==__c4
__b__there is an alternative .__c0
__b__unless someone ==__ca
__qy^rt.%--__there is an alternative .__c0
__s__i mean it's still there's uh - you know your point stands about there be - needing to be an infrastructure .__c0
__s^aa__but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock's timer on it .__c0
__s^aa|s__you c- - i mean i - when i - when i did it i synchronized it by voice .__c0
__s^aa__by whispering one two three four onto the microphone .__c0
__s__huh ==__ca
__s^aa__and uh | you know .__c0
__qw^br__well but then there's the infrastructure at the other end .__ca
__s^r__right .__c4
__b__which someone has to listen to that and find that point .__ca
__%--__yeah it's transcribed .__c0
__s__and then mark it .__ca
__s__it's in the transcript .__c0
__b^rt__so ==__ca
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__well it's in the transcript .__c0
__b__well could we keep one of these things for another year ?__c9
__sj^ba__would h- - i mean is there a big cau- ==__c9
__b__we can keep all - both of them for the whole whole year .__ca
__b__just - just in case we ==__c9
__s__i mean it's just ==__ca
__s.%--__even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate .__c9
__s__uh f- - just there's a bunch of things that might be neat to do .__c9
__fh__but i - it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure .__c9
__s__but we could at least try it out .__c9
__s^aa__well | one thing that we might try um is on some set of meetings - some collection of meetings - maybe e d u is the right one or maybe something else .__c1
__s^arp__we - we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task .__c1
__s__i mean ==__c1
__fh__right .__c9
__s__uh part of the reason - i think part of the reason that adam was so interested in uh the speechcorder sort of f- - idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes .__c1
__fh__yep .__ca
__s^no__and ==__c1
__s__and so forth .__c1
__b__so | and - and jane is more into it .__c1
__fh__but uh uh ==__c1
__qy.%-__you know i don't know if you want to really do - do this all the time .__c1
__s.%--__so i think the thing is to - to get someone to actually buy into it .__c1
__s^bk^rt__and have at least some series of meetings where we do it .__c1
__s__um ==__c1
__qy^d^rt__and if so it's probably worth having one .__c1
__h__the p- - the - the problem with the - the more extended view ==__c1
__%-__all these other you know with uh quibbling about particular applications of it ==__c1
__s^aa|s__is that it looks like it's hard to get people to um - uh - routinely use it .__c1
__s^df__i mean it just hasn't happened anyway .__c1
__s^aa__but maybe if we can get a person to ==__c1
__s.%--__yeah i don't think it has to be part of a- - what everybody does in a meeting .__c9
__s__but it might be a useful neat part of the project .__c9
__s^aa__that we can you know show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time .__c9
__s^aa__that happen that you just want to make a note of .__c9
__s__like what jane was talking about .__c9
__s.%--__with some later browsing just - just as a convenience .__c9
__s__even if it's not a full blown note taking substitute .__c9
__fh__well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a p d a with a wireless card .__c4
__fg|s^df.%--__and - and that way you can synchronize very easily with the - the - the meeting .__c4
__b__because you'll be synchroni- - you can synchronize with the - the linux server .__c4
__fg|s__and uh ==__c4
__s__so what kind of input would you be ?==__c9
__s__so - so i mean if you're not worried about ==__c4
__s__buttons .__ca
__s^aa__you'd just be pressing like a - a ?==__c9
__fh__well - well you have a p d a .__c4
__s^bk__and may- - and you could have the same sort of x interface or whatever .__c4
__sj^ba__i mean you'd have to do a little uh - a little bit of coding to do it .__c4
__s.%-__uhhuh .__c9
__s__but you could imagine ==__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c9
__b__that be good .__c9
__qw.%--__i mean if - if all you really wanted was - you didn't want this secondary note taking channel .__c4
__x__but just sort of being able to use m- - markers of some sort .__c4
__fh__a p d a with a l- - a wireless card would be the - probably the right way to go .__c4
__qy.%--__i mean even buttons you could do .__c4
__qy^d^rt__sort of .__c4
__qy^d^rt__i mean as you said .__c4
__qrr.%-__i mean for what - what you've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else .__ca
__h|s__m- ==__c9
__qy^rt__right .__c9
__s.%--__right ?__ca
__s^aa|s__that would be fine too .__c9
__s^bk__you have the ==__ca
__s__right .__c4
__s.%--__i mean i don't have you know grandiose ideas in mind .__c9
__s__but i'm just sort of thinking well we've - we're getting into the next year now .__c9
__%-__and we have a lot of these things worked out at - in terms of the speech .__c9
__s^aa__maybe somebody will be interested in this .__c9
__fh__and ==__c9
__s^bu__i like this p d a idea .__c0
__s^aa|s.%--__yeah .__c0
__b__yeah i do like the idea of having a couple buttons .__c1
__s__well i'm sure there would ==__ca
__b__yeah .__c9
__%--__where like one - one button was uh oh .__c1
__b__yeah .__c0
__s.%--__and then another button was that's great .__c1
__s__and another button that's f- ==__c1
__s.%--__or like this is my i'm supposed to do this kind of button .__c9
__s__yeah .__c0
__%-__like i better remember to ==__c9
__qy^rt^t1__action item .__ca
__h__yeah .__c9
__s^no^t1__something like that .__c9
__qw.%-__or ==__c9
__fg|s__i mean i think the crosspad idea is a good one .__ca
__s__and then ==__c0
__%-__uhhuh .__c0
__s^bk__it's just a question of getting people to use it .__ca
__s__and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it's not a lot of extra work .__ca
__s__i mean that's part of the reason why it hasn't happened .__ca
__qw.%__is that it - it's been a lot of extra work for me .__ca
__s__yeah .__c9
__b__right .__c1
__b__and ==__ca
__b__well and not just for you .__c0
__s__w- ==__c9
__s^bu__but it's also it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a d- - a digital record too .__c0
__s^aa__doesn't it ?__c0
__s^aa.%__well it's digital but it's in a format that is not particularly standard .__ca
__s^bk__i mean ==__c0
__qw.%-__but i mean say if i- - if - if you're writing - if you're writing notes in it does - it - it can't do handwriting recognition .__c0
__s.%-__right ?__c0
__s__no no | but it's just - it's just storing the pixel informa- - position information .__c1
__qw^br__okay .__c0
__s^r__it's all digital .__c1
__s^df__i - i guess what i'm thinking is that the p d a solution you h- - you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a - to a ==__c0
__%--__i mean ==__c0
__s^bk__right .__c1
__s.%--__you don't have to ==__c1
__b__the transfer function is less errorful .__c4
__qr^d__yes .__c4
__h|s__yeah yeah .__c9
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__s^df__oh nicely put .__c0
__qw__yeah yeah .__c1
__b__well it also - it's maybe realistic because people are supposed to be bringing their p d a's to the meeting eventually .__c9
__s.%--__right ?__c9
__b__that's why we have this little ==__c9
__sj^ba__i don't know what - i don't want to cause more work for anyone .__c9
__b__but i can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it .__c9
__b__and so if we don't have to return it ==__c9
__b__and we can keep it for a year ==__c9
__b__i don't know .__c9
__s__well | w- - we don't - we certainly don't have to return it .__ca
__fg__as i said all - all he said is that if you're not using it could you return it if you are using it feel free to keep it .__ca
__fg|s__the point is that we haven't used it at all .__ca
__s__and are we going to .__ca
__fh.%__so we have no ==__c1
__s^cs__but - uh by i - i would suggest you return one .__c1
__s^no__okay .__ca
__qy^d^rt__yeah .__c9
__qy^g^rt__because we - we you know we - we haven't used it at all .__c1
__s^rt__we c- ==__c9
__fh|qy^rt__we have some aspirations of using them .__c1
__h|s^aa__one would probably be fine .__c9
__s.%--__maybe we could do like a student project .__c9
__s^aa|s__and ==__c1
__s^rt__you know maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s- - project for something would be cool .__c9
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^2__yep .__ca
__s.%--__i mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more .__ca
__s__maybe jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there - when - when somebody laughed .__c1
__b.%__although there is a little ==__ca
__s^bk__well | i'm - yeah that's not a bad ==__c9
__sj^ba__yeah yeah .__c1
__sj^ba__yeah .__c1
__s^rt__jeremy's going to be an - he's a new student starting on modeling brea- - breath and laughter actually .__c9
__s^aa__which sounds funny .__c9
__b__but i think it should be cool .__c9
__b__so ==__c9
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__b__sounds breathy to me .__ca
__fh__okay .__c9
__s.%--__breath and lau- ==__ca
__fh__ha ha ha .__c9
__qw^rt__ha ha ha ha .__ca
__qrr^rt__ha ha ha ha .__ca
__qy^d^g^rt__well dear !__c1
__h__um ==__ca
__s^ar__huh .__c1
__%--__that reminded me of something .__ca
__qy^rt__oh well .__ca
__s^aa|s^na^rt__too late .__ca
__b__it slipped out .__ca
__s^bk__okay .__c1
__s^bu__oh !__ca
__s^aa|s^na__you're - you're going to tease me ?__c9
__s__equipment .__ca
__b__okay .__c9
__s^rt__ordered ==__ca
__b^rt__uh well i'm always going to do that .__ca
__b__w- - uh | we ordered uh more wireless .__ca
__s__and so they should be coming in at some point .__ca
__b__great .__c9
__s__and then at the same time i'll probably rewire the room as per jane's suggestion .__ca
__s__so that uh the first n channels are wireless - uh are the m- - the close talking - and the next n are far field .__ca
__s__you know what he means .__c1
__s__but isn't that funny sounding ?__c1
__b__we ordered more wireless .__c1
__s__it's like wires are the things .__c1
__s__so you're wiring  - you're - you're - you - we're - we ordered more absence of the thing .__c1
__s^rt__that's a very philosophical statement from morgan .__c9
__qo__wired less wired more .__ca
__s^e__i just - it's sort of a anachronism .__c9
__s__i mean it's like ==__c9
__s^rt__it's great .__c9
__s.%--__should we do digits ?__ca
__s__anyway .__c1
__qo^e__do we have anything else ?__ca
__qo^e__yeah .__c1
__qo^e__okay .__c0
__qo^e__i mean there's - there's all this stuff going on uh between uh andreas and - and - and dave and chuck and others with various kinds of runs .__c1
__s__uh um | recognition runs .__c1
__s__trying to figure things out about the features .__c1
__qo__but it's - it's all sort of in process .__c1
__s.%--__so there's not much to say .__c1
__s.%--__right now .__c1
__s.%--__uh | why don't we start with our - our esteemed guest ?__c1
__s__okay .__c4
__b__all right .__c4
__qy^d^f^g^rt__so just the transcript number and then the - then the ==__ca
__s__this is ==__c4
__s.%--__yes | this is number two for me today .__c4
__b__see all you have to do is go away to move way up in the ==__c1
__b__oh .__c4
__s__we could do simultaneous .__c9
__s__initiate him .__c9
__s__we - we could .__c1
__b__should we do simultaneous ?__ca
__s__well | i'm just thinking are you going to try to save the data before this next group comes in ?__c9
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__ca
__s__absolutely .__ca
__s__yeah so we might want to do it simultaneous .__c9
__s^e.%--__i mean you hav- - sort of have to .__ca
__b__right | so ==__c9
__b__well | okay so let's do one of those simultaneous ones .__c1
__s__so we might n- - we might need to do that actually .__c9
__s__okay .__ca
__b__that sounds good .__c1
__%--__okay .__c4
__s__everybody ready ?__c1
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__a one .__c1

__s__i don't know about other people .__ca
__s^rt__or you start laughing .__c9
__b__okay all right .__c4
__s^rt__you don't have to .__c3
__s:s^fe^rt__okay .__c1
__s^rt__a one and a two and a three .__c1
