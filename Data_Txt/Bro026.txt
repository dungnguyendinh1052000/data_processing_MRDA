__b__@@ ==__c0
__b__okay .__c8
__fg|s__so we should be on .__c8
__s__so ==__c3
__qy^rt__and i'm going to go ahead and start by reading the digit strings .__c8
__b__just to give you an example of how to do it .__c8
__s^aa__and so the first thing to do is read the transcript number .__c8
__s^aa^r__which is on the right hand side there .__c8
__s__DIGIT_TASK__c8
__s^bk__and so if you could just go around the table .__c8
__qy^d^g^rt__and read them out .__c8
__s^aa__okay .__ca
__s^bk__should i next ?__ca
__s^na__yep .__c8
__s__DIGIT_TASK__ca
__fh__DIGIT_TASK__c1
__b__DIGIT_TASK__c3
__qw__if you could sign that ?__c8
__qy^bu^m^rt__DIGIT_TASK__c4
__s^aa__thanks .__c8
__s__DIGIT_TASK__c0
__s__DIGIT_TASK__c2
__qy^rt__thanks .__c8
__s.%-__so i wanted to just era- - it- - reiterate because we did have have one person come in a little later that um there will be an opportunity to remove anything from the transcript that you don't want made public after it's transcribed .__c8
__b__so that'll be some months off .__c8
__qy^rt__but you will have that opportunity .__c8
__qrr.%--__okay ?__c8
__sj^ng.%-__thanks .__c8
__sj^m^ng^rt__okay .__c1
__fh__okay .__c3
__b__thanks adam .__c3
__fg|sj__we could start with our meeting ?__c3
__s^bk__yep !__c8
__sj__yep !__c3
__s^aa__thanks very much .__c8
__s^aa^m__okay .__c3
__s^aa^m__you have to stay all the time here ?__c3
__s__i don't have to .__c8
__s^bk__um ==__c8
__%--__but ch- - you want to do ?__c3
__s__well .__c8
__s^bk^m__it's just at the end of the meeting don't turn off the mikes .__c8
__b__just leave them on .__c8
__s^bk__okay .__c1
__s__and uh ==__c8
__b__uh ==__c8
__fh__actually could y- - actually could you call me at the end of the meeting ?__c8
__fh|s__i'll leave my number on the board there .__c8
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__okay .__c3
__qy^rt__thanks .__c8
__b__we can do that .__c3
__s^bk__hey adam you know what ?__ca
__h|s^no.%-__it must be funny to do an a- - research on how people behave while reading these numbers .__ca
__s^cs__numbers are strange !__c8
__s^cs.%-__that must be ==__ca
__qy^rt__it is !__c8
__s^ar__yeah !__ca
__s^bk__it must be much more interesting to - to see their behavior .__ca
__s^cc__the - the meetings are strange .__c8
__sj^ba__oh y- - yeah !__ca
__b__people interrupt each other much more than i thought they did .__c8
__s^aa__two nine seven seven ?__c3
__s__right .__c3
__s__two nine seven seven .__c8
__qy^d^rt__okay .__c3
__qy^d^rt__okay .__c1
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__sj^ba__i will call you then .__c3
__b__thanks .__c8
__b__uh okay .__c3
__s__so then let's start with our weekly meeting .__c3
__s__the last time's uh we learned too much i believe .__c3
__s^rt__so ==__c3
__b__uh | today i have two topics .__c3
__b__and the first topic um we have a new member in our group .__c3
__s^bu__miguel sanchez .__c3
__%-__i believe everybody knows him very well in the meantime because he stayed here quite a little time .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__hi .__c1
__s^aa__and i think he is talking to everybody in the meantime .__c3
__s^df__so but anyway i would like that miguel sanchez will introduce himself a little bit concerning his background what he intend to do .__c3
__s.%-__and - | because i discussing with him uh uh many things concerning uh his skills and what the n. s. a group intends to do .__c3
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c1
__s^bu__i hope there will be a match uh then for his future work .__c3
__s^aa__and the second topic is then to discuss a proposal in much more detail .__c3
__s^aa__i believe we still haven't left our starting position .__c3
__s^bk__and um | yesterday i also discussed with wilbert some things .__c3
__s^bk__and i would like to focus on the question what problem we are going to solve with such a proposal .__c3
__s^bu__not so will they have a common activity within the group itself and maybe with other partners outside .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__but the technical problem .__c3
__%-__but that's under the s- - second topic .__c3
__s^aa|s__so first i would like that miguel will told us a little bit about his skills and - and uh his background .__c3
__s^bk__okay .__c1
__s^bu.%-__okay .__c1
__s__thank you joe .__c1
__s__so please .__c3
__s^bk__well i uh as all of you know i came from - from spain .__c1
__s__from the uh polytechnic university of valencia .__c1
__s__and i- - uh | i um just finished my p. h. d thesis about uh um- - power saving techniques for wireless networking .__c1
__b__uh | in fact i have developed an algorithm to control the ra- - radio frequency power uh of a wireless transceiver .__c1
__b__and uh | i've been working also in routing issues especially in the so-called ad hoc netw- - wireless networks .__c1
__h__where uh you have a set of uh mobile nodes and no other infrastructure .__c1
__sj__no base stations .__c1
__b__so all the routing functions are done by the node - by the same nodes .__c1
__s^df__okay ?__c1
__s^aa__so nodes act as both end points and routers .__c1
__s^aa^r__uh ==__c1
__s__i've in the study for some time these kind of networks .__c1
__s^df__and uh in fact there are a lot of - of research uh articles about this - this kind of networks because you know uh huh infrastructure based network network has been a long topic of research .__c1
__s^df__so ==__c1
__fh__for example routing on - on wired networks is a - a topic still to be researched .__c1
__b__but it has an important background .__c1
__fh__but mobile network- - this kind of mobile networks is a little bit - uh newer .__c1
__s^bk__especially because uh until not so long uh the - the things were too heavy to have a computer a wireless transceiver on a more or less portable thing .__c1
__s^bk__so | with the advent of this new technology low power uh high uh processing capability and wireless - uh - networking capability in a really small package new kind of devices are - are being built and are appearing in the market .__c1
__b__and uh | well this is more or less what i have done .__c1
__fg__and the kind of uh things i'm interested is more or less all around this these kind of networks .__c1
__qw^t__but i could say uh in general mobile service is not only about uh these specific kind of networks .__c1
__s__but in general about uh services uh over mobile or services that can benefit from the uh capability of nodes to move around .__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__and uh | well i - i've been teaching now for twelve years comp- - uh at a computer sciences school in my university .__c1
__fh__i've been teaching computer networks .__c1
__h|s^m.%--__and well i am - more or less uh knowledgeable about well t. c. p i. p networking i. s. o uh networking .__c1
__s__and uh ==__c1
__s^rt__well i'm - i'm a computer guy .__c1
__s^bk__so i'm really um well i can say uh proudly uh more or less computer skilled .__c1
__s^rt__i mean uh operating systems uh programming languages uh networking @@ .__c1
__h__so this kind of things i think i'm more or less well-trained .__c1
__s^co^t__so ==__c1
__s^bk__this is i think um my first presentation .__c1
__b__next - maybe next meeting i will uh do a small sketch about uh my past work and well presenting some det- - a little bit more detailed approach with some schemes and - and some things from previous talks so you can have a better idea of w- - the kind of work i've been doing .__c1
__qy^bu^d__okay ?__c1
__fh__uhhuh .__c3
__s^aa__thank you .__c1
__s.%--__so thanks miguel .__c3
__b__yeah we m- - discussed it yesterday that you'll maybe will have a talk next tuesday .__c3
__s:qw^t__y- ==__c1
__b__yeah .__c1
__fh|s:qw__but give me a sign and send me an abstract so that i can announce it then for the next meeting .__c3
__s.%--:qw.%--__yeah .__c1
__fh__that's okay .__c1
__s__um ==__c3
__s__one short other topic is uh claudia did a lot of work concerning the web pages in the meantime .__c3
__s__oh .__ca
__b__okay .__ca
__fh__and | despite busy stuff with waivers and uh and visas and whatever uh she found the time to um write with what we discussed before and in the form of h. t. m. l stuff .__c3
__sj^ba__and we want to put it on the web pages in the next days .__c3
__s^cs__so | i will send an email then to everybody that they should check their web pages whether they're aligned with um their own views and opinions of what we should - what should be presented on the web pages .__c3
__s__and any feedback is then well appreciated .__c3
__fh__no ?__c3
__fh|s^co^t__okay .__c1
__fh__so ==__c3
__fg__let's switch to the project proposal .__c3
__fh|s__um | i mentioned that it is still f- ==__c3
__fh__uh .__ca
__qy^rt__sorry .__ca
__s__can i ?==__ca
__s^e__yeah ?__c3
__s^e__maybe i can add something .__ca
__s^e__claudia ==__c3
__h__yeah if there's anything else which we - what we could add on the web site .__ca
__h__so p- - for example if you have a small abstract or some pictures or whatever about the work you did before what you are planning to do here that would be fine .__ca
__qy^bu^d__okay .__c1
__s^aa__because now we can add some more stuff there .__ca
__%-__or if you have something - or if somebody has some slides o- - or articles whatever he wants to be published there .__ca
__s^aa^r__yeah .__c3
__qr^bu^d__then everybody sees the structure - how it is uh structured - really structured .__c3
__%-__yeah .__ca
__b__and ==__ca
__h|s__then maybe you wi- - can easy offer some additional input which should be presented then on the web pages .__c3
__fh__yeah | it depends what - what everybody wants to do .__ca
__s^bu^m__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__so ==__ca
__fg|s__about the projects will be something .__ca
__s__then about publications will be another point .__ca
__fh__and yeah additional information about how is life in berkeley and i- - yep i don't know some - some hints some web sites or links which are useful when somebody arrives or stuff like that .__ca
__s^rt__yeah it is .__c3
__s^cc__yeah .__c3
__b__uhhuh huh .__c1
__fh__half collection of necessary information .__c3
__s^co__but there's no personal homepage for everybody ?__c4
__s__or | is it planned or not ?__c4
__s__yeah su- - you can have ==__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__or ==__c4
__s^aa__yeah | you can have it .__c3
__fh__because as uh uh uh le- ==__c3
__fh|s^cs__i'm not interested in this .__c4
__s^aa.%-__that makes work .__c4
__h|s^cs^r__no .__c3
__s^arp__but this is - oh uh - everybody's obliged to do it for his own you know .__c3
__s^df__yeah .__c4
__s__so there is not uh - claudia is not the webmaster here to uh get the collection for - for - for everything .__c3
__s^bu__okay .__c4
__s.%-__oh oh no | i'm not doing it for everybody .__ca
__s^aa__so ==__c3
__fg|s__but what i can ==__ca
__s__this is responsible for - uh everybody's responsible for his own .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^cs__yeah | but - but what is planned is that i do something like a- - previous you know layout and give everybody the uh opin- - uh the possibility to the chance to put his content inside .__ca
__b^rt__sure .__c4
__%--__okay .__c4
__b__his name and so on .__c4
__fh__so that the layout is for everybody the same .__ca
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah .__c4
__s^ar|%-__well like have a blueprint .__c1
__s^2.%-__so about the projects and stuff .__ca
__s__okay .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s^aa__so there will be something .__ca
__b__yeah .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c3
__b__okay .__c3
__fh|s.%--__thanks .__c3
__s__so ==__c3
__s^df__let's switch to the proposal .__c3
__s__i ask everybody whether read it in the meantime and understand everything .__c3
__sj__yeah .__c3
__sj.%--__everybody say yes ?__c3
__s__yeah ?__c3
__s__yes .__c4
__s__yes .__c3
__s__okay .__c3
__fh|sj__um ==__c3
__s__from my point of view as i mentioned before we still in the starting position .__c3
__s__i think the four building blocks on the network level will have really a major impact on - on f- - current um available wireless networks and uh also for future generations .__c3
__s__and | what the missing thing is really what kind of problem we are wan- - want to s- - solve with such a project proposal .__c3
__s__and wilbert yesterday mentioned and he is right that what kind of maybe service we are really going to offer .__c3
__fh|s__the linkage between such kind of application also interactive multimedia application and uh this kind of networking stuff is um maybe not very well aligned .__c3
__s__because there will be of course a portion of mobile access to such kind of application .__c3
__s^co.%--__but i think that's not the majority .__c3
__s__and that is not the major focus of um this kind of - um this kind of application anyway .__c3
__s^co__so i would like to - to - uh split in principle the discussions of what kind of application tsk um f- - far away .__c3
__b__and i would like to - more to focus if we have certain kind of vision t- - concerning these building blocks and the network um what kind of problem we are going to solve .__c3
__fh__what kind of uh um um glue between these four building blocks exists .__c3
__fh|s^t__and | what kind of synergy effects in principle as if they work and fit very well together exists for networking stuff .__c3
__s^co^t__and what kind of service could we provide in that area .__c3
__fg|s__we will have these kind of uh really closely working together of these four building blocks .__c3
__s__so maybe uh wilbert you can start to discu- - oder to - to tell the group about what you mentioned yesterday concerning certain kind of ideas .__c3
__%-__maybe it's a brainstorming um of - of these things .__c3
__s^aa|s^rt__and maybe we can comment later on th- - these - uh these ideas .__c3
__b__and i saw you sk- - still discuss with - with - uh - mark | right ?__c3
__s^rt__some stuff .__c3
__b__was it also related with - with these things ?__c3
__h__no .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__no .__c3
__s^aa__okay it was @@ .__c3
__s^bk__this afternoon you mean ?__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c3
__s^rt.%-__no | this was unrelated to - to the things of yesterday and last weeks .__c2
__s^2__okay .__c3
__s^m__yeah yeah .__c3
__h|s^2__then maybe then one - one w- - uh sentence before .__c3
__%-__wha- ==__c2
__s^m__i believe everybody fits very well in these kind of things .__c3
__s__because from the mathematical description with q. s. in advance me as an expert for quality of service and uh michael as an expert for uh m. p. l. s and wilbert an expert for - for multicast and uh i discussed with miguel it's uh maybe a little bit the shift to active routing .__c3
__s^m__but it is still in the area of routing .__c3
__s__so my idea is in principle to have independently of any funding independently of any outer contact such - such a core activity in principle .__c3
__s^m__and we can see how much from the outer world can fit in .__c3
__s__first of all the first stage is the institution which is behind everybody .__c3
__s__that means uh k. p. n in your case and siemens in our case .__c3
__s^bk|s^bu__and maybe then in the broader world here other partners registered in the proposal migh- ==__c3
__fh__tomorrow i will go to cisco for instance .__c3
__s^aa__and i will discuss uh all this kind of things .__c3
__fh__maybe they have certain additional activities and they're interested in the results before .__c3
__s__the benefit here is in principle that the results are available .__c3
__s__they are not restricted any way .__c3
__b^rt__if you have your own common activity that makes a little bit more easier .__c3
__s__and uh | if there is a technical linkage between such uh um between the outer world and us okay the better it is .__c3
__b__but anyway if we come to a certain kind of uh common work within the core of the n. s. a group i think that's really beneficial to everybody .__c3
__b__and uh | especially wilbert if you have in mind to go in the huh uh really from the project proposal view i think we can build it on this - this core .__c3
__s.%--__you know ?__c3
__s.%--__and go to the outer world with and - and - and align it in a certain way .__c3
__s__for instance that it also fit maybe to k. p. n and siemens and in other companies .__c3
__%--__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah and this probably has to be a brainstorm right now .__c2
__s__yep .__c3
__s__um | what i told joachim yesterday was that uh uh for my company - the company i work for they are more interested in - in an explicit service than in core technology .__c2
__s__u- ==__c2
__fh__me on the other hand i'm more interested in uh core service or c- - core technology myself .__c2
__qy^d^rt__so i'm u- - i was thinking about uh how i could combine the both of them .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__k. p. n was um - they're interested in having uh like six people or something working on the project for one year .__c2
__s^aa|s__or maybe uh three people fo- - working on the project for two years .__c2
__fh|s__and have a kind of a demonstration uh for a specifically in- - u. m. t. s service .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__fh__i was thinking that um as a - well not really a u. m. t. s service but - yesterday what i discussed with joachim was uh a w- - little bit based on your ad hoc networking also .__c2
__s__that it would be interesting to have a kind of a device where you can switch from w- - a wavelan technology to um u. m. t. s .__c2
__s__i think that's uh it's in - in the future that will be a main competitor of uh of u. m. t. s .__c2
__b__uhhuh huh .__c1
__s__too like the - the - the lucent uh equipment has a l- - huge scope already .__c2
__fh__like five hundred feet or - or even more sometimes .__c2
__fh|sj__so that's - it's might be interesting for a service to walk into a building or whatever is available on that network .__c2
__s__you can switch from u. m. t. s or uh uh to wavelan technologies .__c2
__b__huh .__c3
__s__uhhuh huh .__c1
__fh__uh maybe i will write a few keywords on the - on the whiteboard .__c3
__qw__sure .__c2
__b^rt__okay ?__c3
__%-__of course it sounds strange for a company that does u. m. t. s to switch - to - to be able to switch or provide the service to switch to wavelan .__c2
__s^e__but at the end it makes it easier for your - and cheaper for your customers .__c2
__s__so if they don't do it somebody else will probably do it .__c2
__s__and you can build a - a - an - a - a double technology adapter too .__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__so you can market these double technology adapters .__c1
__fh__and this can be a - a potential uh um you know uh income too .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__s^nd__because you just have to license uh uh wavelan technology .__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__you can build uh the whole thing .__c1
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__s^aa.%__this u.  - u. m. t. s wavelan uh- - mixed together .__c1
__fh.%__and ==__c2
__s^bk^rt__yeah | something like that could be possible .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__maybe even a u. m. t. s. to wavelan gateway .__c2
__fg__or - i'm not sure if that's possible like we- - u.  - if u. m. t. s re- - contains redirects or whatever like switches .__c2
__qy.%--__i'm not sure about it .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__it could be .__c2
__s^aa__huh .__c1
__s^bk__i think they are using different uh radio technologies .__c1
__s__so uh | at the physical level they're - they're - they are not compatible .__c1
__fh__it's not a problem .__c2
__s^df__no | but s- - you could have a u. m. t. s gateway that translates everything to that uh w- - local @@ .__c2
__b__yeah .__c1
__b^rt__yeah .__c1
__b^rt__if you will .__c2
__b__that - that's right .__c1
__b^rt__yet the basic idea is in principle to switch seamlessly between wireless lan technology whatever and u. m. t. s .__c3
__qy^d^f^rt__right ?__c3
__fh__yes .__c2
__qw__and | you see the benefit that in principle the customer will save a lot of money .__c3
__s__because if in-house communication like wavelan or maybe i see it also in the american market some wavelan communication in the outer world will be available the m- - and that is your assumption that the more cost uh extensive um u. m. t. s connection could be principle used i would like to say over wavelan .__c3
__s__and then i have a normal wavelan connection | right ?__c3
__s^e__yes .__c2
__b__and the router and the wavelan connection goes into the core internet elsewhere .__c3
__s^bk^rt__and | the connection is not dropped between this seamless hand off i would like to say .__c3
__s^bk^rt__uhhuh .__c2
__fh|s__right ?__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__or what - or ==__c3
__%-__well .__c2
__h|s^nd__if connection is lost i am - i'm not sure if sometimes you'd simply have to drop a connection if you have outstanding connections .__c2
__qy^d^rt__what ==__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__yeah .__c0
__s^aa__but that's uh one thing of the internet .__c2
__sj.%-__right ?__c2
__fg|s^nd__it's - should be able to unplug a host bring it somewhere else and everything continues like it should be .__c2
__qy^rt__i'm not sure i- - if it's uh - if you really have to con- - uh save a connection for all applications .__c2
__fh__i - i don't think so .__c2
__s__yeah | but if this is the final goal .__c3
__s^aa__it should be as much as possible available that you do not have to break the connection if you switch between the subnets' technology .__c3
__s__right ?__c3
__qy^rt__yeah | but i - i have a point uh regarding the - this question is uh the cost function .__c1
__s__i mean .__c1
__s__uh ==__c1
__s__what about the user who is switching from one - let's say - zero cost area network to another network where he has to pay ?__c1
__s^aa^m__it is okay for the service to continue when he uh switches from one network to another .__c1
__sj^fe__but probably the user wants to be aware that he's switching from one place - from one network to another .__c1
__s__because maybe while he's uh having let's say a vide- - video conference uh over the - the wavelan oh he's not paying any extra cost .__c1
__s__but when he continues with this service on the u. m. t. s he's having to cover uh an important - let's say an important cost - or some cost - non-null cost .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c3
__b__non-null @@ .__c3
__b__so uh ==__c1
__fh|s__this can be something that probably the user wants to be aware of .__c1
__fh|s__of course this doesn't mean that the user wants the connection to be dropped when he switches to the w- - uh r- - uh from the zero cost area network to - to the - uh um non-null cost area network .__c1
__s__but maybe some users want to do this .__c1
__%-__because they say okay .__c1
__qw__i'm not willing to pay any back for this service .__c1
__s^e.%--__because i'm just watching uh you know the sports news .__c1
__fg|qy^bu^rt__so if i switch - if - if because of my motion i'm switching or i'm going out of the coverage of the - of the uh wave - uh wireless uh local area network well i - i want the service to be uh stopped .__c1
__s^aa__and this can be some pattern then that some users will follow .__c1
__fg|%-__yeah .__c0
__s.%-:qw.%-__yeah | but if your s- ==__c3
__sj__uh | i believe everybody is aware about the u. s. a. i. a architecture .__c3
__s__and uh | this one is here - this stuff is here also related to this kind what is mentioned there concerning the end system .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__and in my conf- - uh considered end system there is a certain kind of policy concerning how to use subnets technologies and - and all these kind of things .__c3
__b.%__how to use quality of service you know in advance .__c3
__s__because you have to pay for certain technologies and maybe for certain services .__c3
__s^e__and that should not be done automatically .__c3
__s__but it could be done automatically .__c3
__s__but nevertheless there must be a certain kind of um user interaction always possible that you could set up a certain kind of mini database how to deal with all these kind of things .__c3
__s__i think that's not a problem .__c3
__s__but uh what i - i would like to ask wilbert here and we discuss it yesterday is it only the usage of that p. c. m. c. i. a card where you have instead of g. s. m today u. m. t. s and instead of wireless lan today also wireless lan .__c3
__s__remember your four and one card uh concerning um ==__c3
__%-__what is the name from dataco- ?==__c3
__s__no .__c3
__s^2.%__dacom .__c3
__s^bk__oh | the one i have sitcom ?__c2
__s^bk^r__where you can enable four technologies and you plug in in your laptop .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c2
__qy^bu^rt__and then you have every four uh subnet layer technologies available in your laptop .__c3
__qy^bsc^rt__is that the problem ?__c3
__s^aa__yeah that's not the problem .__c3
__s^aa__right .__c3
__qw__um ==__c2
__qy^rt__well the switching itself could be a problem .__c2
__sj^ar__why ?__c3
__h|s__becau- - well it's a depends .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__maybe you are .__c2
__s^bk__i don't know .__c2
__s^bk^rt__so that could be a t- - topic for research .__c2
__fg__yeah but | this i- ==__c3
__s^cs__so maybe you know more about it .__c2
__s^aa__yeah | but this is th- - only the probing to figure out that you get at a certain location the information that a s- - certain coverage of a certain subnet techn- - technology is available .__c3
__s^aa^r__and if so then what miguel mentions then you add a certain kind of policy to switch or not to switch to this kind of technology .__c3
__fh|s__yeah .__c2
__s__right ?__c3
__b^rt__y- - yes .__c2
__fh__but this is end system related .__c3
__s__that's not network related .__c3
__qr^bu__i see no network related stuff within these in this uh idea .__c3
__s__um ==__c2
__s__it's only to set up i- - u- ==__c3
__s__for me it's like a laptop t- - to plug one p. c. m. c. i. a - and currently will have two p. c. m. c. i. a cards and i compare g. s. m with u. m. t. s .__c3
__fh__uhhuh huh .__c1
__s__and today i would like to have g. s. m .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__and then i have my g. s. m connectivity .__c3
__s^aa__and i cannot use it other technology .__c3
__fh|s__only g. s. m because the interfaces the driver interface does not permit me to switch between the - between different technologies .__c3
__s__so if i want to go to wireless lan i have to stop my connection and put in my wireless lan p. c. m. c. i. a card .__c3
__fh__and then i can go on and set up the - the same connection one more time .__c3
__sj__and what you have in mind to do it a bit more seamlessly and that makes an only sense for me if both technologies in principle were close together in that sense for application .__c3
__s^no__for instance the application would be that i have my laptop here .__c3
__qw^rt__and i work here with - wi- - with my device .__c3
__fg__any kind of device .__c3
__h__and i work here in wireless lan area .__c3
__h|qy^bu^d^rt__and then i go outside and want to go still on leaving the coverage of - uh of the - uh wireless lan .__c3
__s^aa__and at a certain state the device uh receives certain signals that the coverage of u. m. t. s or g. s. m is available .__c3
__s^aa__and at that state you automatically or based on the certain kind of user profile switched to the um u. m. t. s or g. s. m st- - uh network .__c3
__sj__that's the only senseful application .__c3
__qh^rt__from my understanding that means only to have a certain kind of control layer for the different drivers .__c3
__sj__which you also mentioned as a u. s. a. i. a architecture .__c3
__s__and uh | then to do the switching for an existing stream or application between these uh transparently to this application between those - uh these both technologies .__c3
__qr^bu^d__maybe there's more potential .__c3
__s__i don't s- - see it .__c3
__s^aa__but maybe you have a additional idea .__c3
__sj__and i don't think that this end system device uh architecture which will come automatically .__c3
__%--__and i believe there's a lot of activity throughout the world .__c3
__s^co__because this seamlessly communication is always mentioned elsewhere where you cou- - where you listen to .__c3
__s__so ==__c3
__s__uh uh- ==__c3
__b__if - if you can leave it out the network that will be really cool .__c2
__s__that's what you w- - what i would like to do .__c2
__s^rt__so ==__c2
__s__yes .__c2
__fh|sj^cs__but when quality of service comes to the uh scene well i think we have a - a bigger problem .__c1
__s.%--__because maybe this - this uh uh seamless migration cannot be seamless at all .__c1
__sj__because maybe the - the quality of service we are getting when we are connected to a certain network let's say high-speed networking cannot be sustained when we are switching to a different technology .__c1
__s__so this is another thing that is uh putting a little bit in more trouble our - our scheme .__c1
__qy^rt__or ==__c1
__qrr.%--__now i would like not to hear only three opinions .__c3
__s^nd__hm- ==__c0
__%__but maybe there are also other opinions .__c3
__%-__okay .__c1
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__oh sorry .__c1
__s^bk__and maybe everybody should uh give a short ==__c3
__s__i think you ==__c0
__s__let us understand built for everybody and their com- - whether their comments .__c3
__s^m__yeah .__c0
__s^bk__i think we should ==__c0
__s__in this thing of seamless handoff - or handovers - should think more maybe in different layers ?__c0
__b__so one layer is having the seamless handover .__c0
__qy^rt__it's clear if a technology doesn't provide that quality of service you can't do magic and have it .__c0
__s^ar|s^df__there are certain constraints on that .__c0
__s^bk__it's true .__c0
__s__that's still in mind .__c0
__%-__but for - with the cases there there it is possible .__c0
__b__so that should be made possible then ?__c0
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c1
__s__yeah .__c1
__%--__yeah .__c1
__s^aa|s__so ==__c0
__fg|s__it can be done .__c1
__fh__it is just huh uh trying to - to - to - to poi- - to pinpoint the - the possible problems .__c1
__qy^rt__yeah .__c0
__qrr.%--__there are still enough problems i- - in doing it .__c0
__s^fe__yeah .__c0
__s^no__yep .__c0
__s^bk__but it might be the wrong thing to promise uh ten megabits to everywhere .__c0
__s.%-__there you are .__c0
__s^aap__but saying okay if it's a - if the technology is okay you can do it .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c1
__s^aa|s^e__in fact if you take the slower technology of the ones you are planning to to support you can offer this warran- - this - uh this throughput as uh the minimum warranty you - you can get .__c1
__b__yep .__c0
__s__yep .__c0
__b__yeah .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__so | if everybody is - is asking for less than this minimum amount no problem at all .__c1
__s^aa^rt__but in this case maybe not too much effort should be put on providing this quality of service .__c1
__sj__because you just have a - usually a huge bandwidth compared on a - a - w- - with what the user is - is using .__c1
__b__yeah .__c0
__sj__yep .__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__i mean if you have a ten megabits bandwidth and the user is asking two kilobits per second of course you can uh build uh certain reserve mechanisms to warranty the user these two kilobits per second bandwidth .__c1
__b__but probably in - it isn't - it is not worth because you have so many uh available bandwidths that maybe uh it is not a problem .__c1
__fh__oh please come in .__c3
__fh|s:qy__hi .__c1
__s:qw__hi .__c0
__s^bk__huh ?__ca
__s__oh !__ca
__fg|%-__okay .__ca
__s^cs__@@ ist fertig .__c0
__s^bk__uh ==__c3
__s.%-__okay .__c3
__s__oh okay .__c1
__fg__good luck .__c3
__sj__the - the thing is that we are looking for a research topic on - on those uh four areas .__c2
__b^rt__yeah .__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__and the building blocks .__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__multicast not a topic .__c3
__s^e__so ==__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__so we ==__c2
__s__routing ?__c3
__b__so - so we went through uh uh to - through multicast .__c2
__fh__so this architecture with m- ==__c2
__fh|s__well at least no wireless environment or a mobile i. p environment comparable to uh u. m. t. s environments we really did not find any well difficulties there .__c2
__b__on the blackboard that is .__c2
__s__of course in real life there will b- - probably be some problems .__c2
__b__have you - have you read about this - uh barwan project held at berkeley university ?__c1
__s:qw__well what you - the pointer - the pointer you sent yesterday .__c3
__s:qy__iceberg ?__c2
__s__yeah .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c3
__b__i c- - i didn't find the time yeah to do so .__c3
__fh__okay .__c1
__fh|qw^rt^t^tc__but ==__c3
__s^cs__uh ==__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__you mean the iceberg project ?__c2
__qy.%--__barwan .__c1
__qrr.%--__barwan of uh e. s ==__c2
__qy^rt__barwan .__c1
__qrr.%-__how's it start ?__c0
__s__i know there's one that's of uh randy katz .__c2
__s^bk__uh da- - it was another related project called daedalus .__c1
__s^bk__yes .__c2
__s__and uh | well it seems they what they were doing was some kind of uh things si- - somehow similar to this .__c1
__fh__they worked together wi- - little bit with nokia ?__c2
__s^cc__u- ==__c1
__fh__uh | don't know .__c1
__s__palo alto ?__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__mountain view ?__c2
__h|s^aa__i - i - i - i just uh take a - a quick uh look at the - at the thing .__c1
__%-__because i - i was uh read about this uh a long time ago .__c1
__s__and it - the - the latest report i - i found was in nineteen ninety eight .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__and in this report well they - they pres- - they have uh some slides some uh papers some - well a lot of things .__c1
__s^ar|s__huh .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__and well the main thing - and the quick uh thing i - i was uh looking at was a - a video available in m. p.-thr- - in m. p. g m. peg format .__c1
__s^aa.%__and uh ==__c1
__s^bk|s^bu__well what this video was presenting was a kind of test of - of one guy with a portable computer moving across different networks .__c1
__s^aa__so starting at the c. s department at berkeley .__c1
__s^bk__and then going out the street .__c1
__fh__switching to the - a campus wide network .__c1
__sj__uh um | i think it's a metricom uh network .__c1
__qw__an- - which is uh a test ==__c1
__s__a ricochet here | right ?__c3
__s^e__ricochet .__c1
__b.x__yeah .__c1
__fg__yeah .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c3
__qy.%--__that's right .__c1
__sj^ba__yeah .__c3
__qy^rt__and then finally switching to - i think it was city p. d or something like this .__c1
__s^fa__okay ?__c1
__s^ar__i - as lo- - uh as the - as the user is moving out of the - of the coverage area of this second network .__c1
__s^ar__and well what they have built is a - a - kind of uh proxy structure .__c1
__s^bk__so they are - they are putting most of the work of this adaptational layer on on the side of the proxies .__c1
__s__so the client or the server is not changed .__c1
__s^bk__it is the proxy the one that does the work .__c1
__b__yeah .__c2
__qw__okay ?__c1
__s.%--__so you can even for example use ==__c1
__b__it's the same ?__c1
__b__uh we just discussed a lot about proxies .__c3
__qy^bu^d__oh okay .__c1
__s^aa__that's a fun @@ .__c3
__qy^rt__i like them .__c2
__s^na__so ==__c2
__s^bk__okay .__c1
__fh__i ==__c1
__%--__it is just that - that - well maybe we can - we can take a look at oh maybe a more in-depth look at this project .__c1
__s^rt__just to see if we are doing the same or if we are doing something similar .__c1
__s^bk__it would be important for us to - to highlight the differences .__c1
__s^co__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__because if not well they can say oh you are doing the same thing .__c1
__s.%-__this was done now .__c1
__qy^d^rt__or maybe talk to them about s- - operations they thought of but didn't touch yet .__c2
__s^nd__yeah | well we are close .__c1
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk__uh | maybe a few comments .__c3
__s^bk^r__first of all um do you mind mi- - miguel to write the name of the project on the whiteboard ?__c3
__s^cs.%--__yeah .__c1
__b__no problem .__c1
__s^bk__so that everybody ==__c3
__s^cs^e__uh | i - i will send also the pointer which miguel sent to me to everybody so that everybody can take a look to this uh project .__c3
__s__i was ==__c2
__s^bk__and uh | i don't know what avail- - information is available .__c3
__s^cc__because i didn't find the time currently to check it out .__c3
__%-__it's a project of the u. c .__c4
__%-__but first of ==__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah .__c1
__sj__oh yeah .__c4
__s__u. c ber- - uh berkeley .__c1
__qy^rt__yeah .__c3
__qrr.%--__wh- - when did you go through this ?__c2
__h|s__yeah .__c1
__s__i'll - i - you - uh | i seen uh uh reports from nineteen ninety- - uh ninety six ninety seven and ninety eight .__c1
__s^bc__because yesterday i was uh well coincidentally i b- - bumped into this project here .__c2
__s^fe__maybe the project ==__c1
__sj^ba__n- - uh ==__c1
__b__it's funny .__c2
__s^am__uh sorry ?__c3
__fg|s.%--__uh do ==__c3
__s__yeah yesterday i was just surfing a little bit .__c2
__s^2__uhhuh .__c3
__s^aa__uh .__c3
__s^bk__and then from nokia i came to this - that project .__c2
__s^bk__uh .__c3
__fh|s^co__okay .__c3
__b__i see .__c3
__fh__so ==__c2
__s.%-__yeah .__c3
__fg|s.%-__nokia research .__c2
__s^aa__i think that - that the leader was uh professor katz .__c1
__s^bk__and then ==__c2
__s^aa^r__@@ okay .__c3
__fh|s.%--__that's right .__c2
__b__and he's also board in nokia research .__c2
__fh__okay .__c1
__fh__so ==__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__fh|s__then the second thing is that uh daimler-chrysler research here in palo alto as well as in germany ulm is doing in principle the same with a car .__c3
__qw^rt__uhhuh .__c1
__s__they have a specific antenna for uh g. s. m oh g. p. s and - and fu- - for future extended g.  - uh g. s. m networks and wireless lan and and other thi- - and other network technology .__c3
__s^bk__in the roof of the car they have a s- - lot of servers .__c3
__s^bk__in the trunk of the car then they collect data how it is - with handoff and all these kind of things .__c3
__fh|s.%--__and they are driving around the different areas .__c3
__s__and the same car exists here in palo alto uh based on wireless lan g. s. m and 2x ricochet networks .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__fh|s__they collect the dat- - collect - collecting a lot of data concerning the seamless handoffs and whether it works very well with speed .__c3
__s__and um ==__c3
__fh__uh thomas is going to build mobile i. p stuff in their servers .__c3
__s^tc__uh ==__c3
__b__because they want to ==__c3
__b__so i think there is a lot of activities in the area .__c3
__sj__uh ==__c3
__s__and my third uh comment is uh if we are going something in that direction that is quite different from this thing here .__c3
__%--__but | anyway maybe as a core technology with a real product in mind .__c3
__qy^rt__i see some difficulty because nobody currently has here certain kind uh of u. m. t. s know how .__c3
__qrr__uhhuh .__c1
__sj__and you need it definitely .__c3
__s.%-__because then - it j- - must be your uh bible i would like to say that you are very familiar with u. m. t. s if you want to go in - in that way .__c3
__%-__and as far as i know the u. m. t. s standardization is not finished yet .__c3
__qy^bu^d^j^rt__ninety percent maybe or eighty percent .__c3
__s^aa__i kno- - i'm not sure .__c3
__s__but uh ==__c3
__s^e__yeah .__c1
__b__b- - le- - let me - let me ask you a question about uh u. m. t. s or - or third or possible fourth- - generation communic- - wireless communication systems .__c1
__fh|s__that ==__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__uh | from the point of view of the user uh is there uh something more that - nnn that - than more speed ?__c1
__s__is there any other advantage from the point of view of the user or of - of the terminals ?__c1
__s__users of - of u. m. t. s ?__c3
__sj__yeah .__c1
__s^e__you can request certain kind of q. s .__c3
__sj__you can even request it in g. p. s .__c3
__s^am__but it's not end to end quality of service .__c3
__s__uhhuh huh .__c1
__b__it is only um what the gateways get .__c3
__fh|s__okay .__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__yeah .__c1
__s__and within the core network there are certain kind of tunnels set up in the core network itself of the access provider .__c3
__s^aa__not the internet backbone core .__c3
__s__and you use certain kind of tunnel mechanism to combine in principle the base station cluster control .__c3
__b__but this is uh is controlled by a certain kind of node .__c3
__fh|s__uhhuh huh .__c1
__s__and you have the gateway to the p. d. n or the public data network .__c3
__s^bk__and between both there's a certain kind of tunnel set up .__c3
__s.%-__but in fact ==__c1
__b__but in - fact now at the g. s. m level what you have is that every voice channel you use provides a - a p- - a pretty fine fixed uh data speed .__c1
__fg|qy.%-__so we can say that every voice channel has an i- - an incr- - uh implied um quality of service .__c1
__s__which is nnn ninety six hundred bits per second .__c1
__s^aa__full duplex .__c1
__qy^bu^rt__you mean now for g. s. m @@ ?__c3
__s^aa__doesn't it ?__c1
__s^bk__or ?==__c3
__b__yeah .__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__fg|s__yeah .__c3
__b^rt__so ==__c1
__s^bu__yeah what is - what means quality of service .__c3
__h|s__a certain degree .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__right ?__c3
__s^am__yeah .__c1
__%-__uh ==__c3
__s__sometimes we have some ==__c3
__fh|%--__no but - | um but not only because of - of data speed .__c1
__%--__but also about delay .__c1
__s^bk__you know .__c1
__%-__because g. s. m networks were developed to y- - uh with a voice service in mind .__c1
__s__uh | delay is also considered in these networks .__c1
__fh__so ==__c1
__fh__uh | in fact for every voice channel you have uh a pretty fine maximum uh delay and jitter and a - a - a specified um data speed .__c1
__sj.%--__so you can scale up - scale up this uh - this um thing by using several channels .__c1
__qy.%-__so in fact you have using just g. s. m technology you have more or less the same building blocks as you can get uh with the u. m. t. s .__c1
__qy^2^d^rt__i mean that one thing is that the technology is a little bit different .__c1
__s^aa__that uh the base station thing is different .__c1
__s^ar__and maybe uh the - the internal routing uh inside the network is different .__c1
__s__but from the point of view of the mobile things uh i'm not sure if - if ==__c1
__b.%__it's packaged data oriented .__c3
__b__it's not really circuit switched .__c3
__s.%-__in u. m. t. s you have always g. p. s as a - a involvement in the core network .__c3
__s^bk__you have in principle the path which still is available for - for the g. s. m network .__c3
__s__also they use in principle the same - uh the same mechanism .__c3
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c1
__s^aa__but you also have a dat- - uh packet oriented communication that's on the g. p. s stuff .__c3
__fg|s__and that's also related to u. m. t. s .__c3
__s__yeah | but the - you know it is also being d- - uh developed this g.  uh p.  - d. p. r. s thing - g. p. r. s thing .__c1
__b__so ==__c3
__fg|sj__that is ==__c3
__sj__which is uh pack- - uh packet data over g. s. m .__c1
__s^am__so ==__c1
__fh__i mean uh i don't see that a - a lot of difference .__c1
__s^tc__we can expect a lot of differences f- - uh from the uh mobile terminal point of view uh when uh u. m. t. s be deployed .__c1
__qy^d^rt^t__what i'm trying to say is that - is that well uh maybe uh it is not a big problem that any of us uh be uh um were um a u. m. t. s expert .__c1
__s^na__because uh i - i don't see - it - i think that the u. m. t. s thing is more a technology issue than a research issue .__c1
__qw__maybe i'm wrong .__c1
__h|s__just es- ==__c1
__qy^bu^d__um ==__c1
__s^aa|s__no | i think there's a lot .__c3
__s^bk__explaining my - m- ==__c1
__s^aa^r__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__i think there's a lot of research .__c3
__s^e__but the question is is this uh a research wh- - in which direction we are going ?__c3
__s^bk__i mean - to be done here .__c1
__s__and because ==__c3
__s__for inf- ==__c3
__s^na__not - not at the ==__c1
__qy^rt__of course you know i'm - i - i agree with you that there are a lot o- - of things to be developed .__c1
__s^ng__but - but the point is that - uh this is probably not here .__c1
__s^bk__because uh well you know the - the - the orientation of our group which is uh networks services and applications not uh wireless technology or the underlying wireless technology .__c1
__s__you think more about hardware technology .__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__s^e__so there is a lot of hardware to develop but not ==__c4
__s^bk__you know radio frequency technology .__c1
__s^bk^r__wide band w- - uh c. d. m. a .__c1
__b__these kind of things all have a lot of things to be - to be - uh researched .__c1
__s__but uh i don't think w- - this is not something we are doing here .__c1
__s^m__right .__c3
__b__but bear in mind the picture is a - is a little bit different .__c3
__s^bk__the picture i have in mind concerning u. m. t. s is first of all if you use u. m. t. s only for voice like you did it or are doing now for g. s. m it's not worth to have this kind of network .__c3
__s__and currently in europe where it will be deployed first i believe it will be very hard in principle to get some money back if you have only for - using it for voice .__c3
__s__voice .__c1
__s^na.%-__yeah .__c1
__b__because they paid a lot of money .__c3
__s.%-__so ==__c3
__s^aa__what is the point ?__c3
__qw.%__the point is that you use the u. m. t. s to connect to the internet and have certain kind of services which are still not available up to now .__c3
__b__but the problem is if you have the internet content and you have maybe your small uh um device of maybe only evolution based for - for these uh new technologies for - for certain mobile phones then you have certain kind of problems .__c3
__fg|qy^bu^rt__uhhuh huh .__c1
__qy^rt__you know ?__c3
__s^na__because you cannot use these things .__c3
__b__and wap is not an answer for - for these kind of things .__c3
__s__you know ?__c3
__qy^d^rt.%--__so ==__c3
__s^bk__the - i believe there is a lot of research work .__c3
__b__and also if you see the end to end scope of the internet from the mobile node up to the certain kind of server correspondent node or whatever you call this destination then you have certain kind of models for instance for the quality of service and all these kind of things .__c3
__s.%-__and then is u. m. t. s only one link where you have certain kind of subnet layer technology .__c3
__s^aa__and you have to match these things anyway .__c3
__b__it's like a normal ethernet .__c3
__b__uhhuh huh .__c1
__fg__whatever you see it is only an additional subnet layer technology .__c3
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__s__and you have all the things mapped to the - uh to - to the - to the - the internet stuff in principle to this technology .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__and furthermore you see that the trend is to put more i. p technology really really i. p technology and not certain kind of modifications and adaptations to their access network itself .__c3
__s^aa__and ==__c3
__s^bk__th- - there's a lot of potential as i believe for - for uh certain research work .__c3
__s__but the question is first of all do we have the competence to do something like that ?__c3
__s__first of all .__c3
__qw__second we are not hardware builders in that sense to set up certain kind of end systems .__c3
__s^bk__we can design them yeah from the protocol layering .__c3
__qy^rt__and - and maybe have some simulations or whatever .__c3
__s^df.%-__but isn't the final outcome really such a device ?__c3
__s^aa__prototype linux based .__c3
__s__and we go around here and we have maybe a g. p. s. base station sponsored by ericsson .__c3
__qy^rt__since they are living not so far away .__c3
__s^aa__and - and maybe wavelan connection here .__c3
__s^aa__now a testbed .__c3
__s__and then - then figure out that it works ?__c3
__s^cs.%-__so that's my point .__c3
__s^cc__well just to make the list a little bit longer .__c2
__s.%-__yep .__c3
__s__may- ==__c2
__s__um | you could also think about uh session management .__c2
__s__i do along with uh the network applications and services uh as you might know .__c2
__fg__it's a - a ==__c2
__fg__if you can do it in the end systems or at sp- - specific servers then i'm in favor of that .__c2
__fg|s^cs__but se- - session management i mean uh the authentication if you go from one network to the other it's not solved .__c2
__s^e__uh ==__c2
__fh__nobody really wants a - a guest on your network .__c2
__qy.%-__unless you get some money through some way - uh through some way .__c2
__s^na__then there is also the session management in the sense that a lot of these things at the barwan project as you said go through proxies .__c2
__s^co__there might be kind of handoffs at - uh at proxies .__c2
__s^bk__like the zip uh - s- - zip proxy that we also discussed before a little bit .__c2
__%-__that - that's als- - i think also in the line of uh session management .__c2
__qy^rt__then there is this uh perfect thing uh the berkeley sockets .__c2
__h__it's almost perfect .__c2
__qh^cs:s__they s- - kind of skipped uh layer five uh session management or session layer i think .__c2
__s^bk__that's um normally with - if you do a socket programming it's directly the prot- - application protocol on layer four uh t. c. p socket or layer five for u. d. p socket .__c2
__s^bk__there might also be some research ==__c2
__s__well .__c2
__b__could you introduce such a session management ?__c2
__s^df__or ==__c2
__%--__norm- - what they do right now is they make it part of the application level protocol .__c2
__b__that's what they do most often .__c2
__s__like with session management for mobile the - uh applications such as ist- - instant messaging or uh talks and so on uh like zip it's just doing a - a reconnect .__c2
__s__if they think that the network is different or different capabilities come into play they simply do a reconnect .__c2
__s^bk__so it's part of the protocol .__c2
__s^bk^r__that's all what i think about session management .__c2
__s^e__like part of - in proxies or is it en- - embedded in application level protocols .__c2
__qy^rt.%-__but it's really higher level .__c3
__s^aa|s__right ?__c3
__s^bk__it's no more related to a network .__c3
__%-__i- - it's ==__c2
__qy^rt__we are leaving the network area .__c3
__s^no__that's dangerous .__c3
__fh__so how do you want to focus on network services .__c2
__s^cs__because if you go to the app- ==__c3
__s^cs__if you ==__c3
__s^bk|qy^bu^d__for me that's starting with middleware aspects .__c3
__%-__you know ?__c3
__s__well the- ==__c2
__s^am__and ==__c3
__s.%--__so network applications if you look at the name of the group one thing is that um the- - they used to call a - a n- - a network that was uh - if it was like distributed between two systems connected by a network .__c2
__fh|s^co__if you look at network from the o. z layer then it's uh level two or something or maybe level three but everything below three .__c2
__%-__so there are i think two - two different interpretations of uh network .__c2
__b__no i believe network is if you see it really from - from the i. p protocol suite is then layer one in principle up t- - including layer four .__c3
__s^cc__despite the fact that layer four is only residing normally in the end system and in the gateways .__c3
__b__but are there network applications then ?__c2
__b__yeah .__c3
__qy^d^f^rt__so the - the name is network services and applications .__c2
__fh__s- - so what could be an en- - example of a network application if you look at the o. z stick ?__c2
__qy^d^rt__yeah | we have i think some .__c3
__h__yeah .__c3
__s^na__do you see this word application related to a network ?__c3
__s__or do you see this word independently ?__c3
__fh|s__that was never discussed in detail .__c3
__fh|s__network services and applications .__c3
__s__so everything in the world .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__okay .__c2
__s^e__or is the application related to the network ?__c3
__s__for my understanding and as far as we discussed so - such a long time uh these applications should .__c3
__s__for instance ecommerce .__c3
__fh|s__okay okay | well they will - i didn't want to get a discussion now .__c2
__fh|s__and it's really really ==__c3
__s__yeah ==__c3
__s__you know ?__c3
__s^2__that ==__c3
__%-__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__no no | uh that is a typical application i think .__c3
__s^m__which is in principle also a little bit related to uh to the network .__c3
__b__but not any application .__c3
__fh__and we also have the aspects for security .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__miguel you mentioned here authentication and - and triple a. .__c3
__s^aa|s__but we do not have any expert anymore .__c3
__b.%__because hannes was an expert for that .__c3
__s__so the problem for me it still exists that we have in principle here basic building blocks in the proposal from the networking side .__c3
__s__we could have a certain kind of application .__c3
__b__and there's a lot of activities in the outside world .__c3
__s__and i believe there's a lot of contacts .__c3
__fh|s__or there could be a lot of contacts uh with - with these people .__c3
__s^df^rt__especially at uh georgia tech .__c3
__s^df^e__i know on - next week on tuesday .__c3
__fh|s__tuesday | right .__c3
__fh|s^cs__we will go to u. c. b .__c3
__s^aa__there are three guys .__c3
__b__then morgan mentioned one .__c3
__sj__i do not know exactly um uh what he is doing .__c3
__fh|s^cs__but he's also interesting in some kind of collaboration .__c3
__qy__he's also a professor in the u. c. b .__c3
__b.%__and uh many universities .__c3
__h|s^bk__maybe claudia mentioned duisburg .__c3
__%-__and uh - in principle most of the university have some activities in that area .__c3
__s__we will not take care about these one .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__but we can use them as um for field ex- - uh field trial access .__c3
__s^aa__and - and - and maybe some support .__c3
__s^aa^r__and - and whatever kind of thing .__c3
__s__and we focus really on the networking stuff .__c3
__s^cs__and going in more detail in this area .__c3
__fh__and the alternative is maybe what uh ==__c3
__fh__currently we have only uh this uh proposal from wilbert to go more in the smaller scope .__c3
__s__figure out some potential from maybe this uh wavelan u. m. t. s stuff .__c3
__s^bk__and - and starting from that .__c3
__s__or are there other suggestions ?__c3
__s^cs__i think we uh have already so much work put into this proposal .__c4
__s^aa__why to switch now ?__c4
__s__so i don't see the reason for that .__c4
__s^aa__maybe the application we suggested is not the best one .__c4
__fh|s__so we have to think about an application which - which is um - um for mobile users more relevant .__c4
__s^e__i don't know .__c4
__b__maybe video games .__c4
__fh|s__if you are traveling ==__c4
__b__uh it's boring to travel .__c4
__fh|s__and then you decide to play a g- - video game with somebody else who's traveling .__c4
__qy^d^df^f^rt__yeah | you know it's still mentioned in the proposal .__c3
__s^aa__so ==__c4
__s__and ==__c3
__fh|sj__th- - um ==__c3
__sj__i - i'm sure okay that it is the wrong place to get the foundation why we are use this kind of application .__c3
__b__but uh - and - in - in the end of the text - in the end of the pr- - text of the proposal .__c3
__fh|sj__but it is mentioned that it is only an example .__c3
__s__and that we use this application in principle while it is then very very easy to get a certain kind of access to these kind of things .__c3
__s.%--__when you have a video game server and - and you want to have mobile access you must at least have one in your consortium or as a partner whatever who provides this service .__c3
__s:qw__and then we - we are playing videos in principle if you have a field trial .__c3
__b__and that is i think much more harder than to have a certain kind of certain kind of access to the university .__c3
__sj__and uh to this server which is run on the campus of the university .__c3
__b__okay | that's right .__c4
__qy^d^f^g^rt__and that is the point .__c3
__s__you can have this f- - to figure out all the things .__c3
__qh__and the - the um ==__c3
__s__and the - the um ==__c3
__b__um now how to say the requirements of this application using this classroom scenario .__c3
__sj__but nevertheless it's not the best for 3x .__c3
__s__and - and - and - and uh ==__c3
__s__s- - networking stuff .__c3
__fh|s^cs__you are right .__c3
__b__but it - does anybody see certain kind of potential here to go on ?__c3
__b__and to start the work maybe in this little bit smaller oh uh scope based on these building blocks .__c3
__s__because multicast you still mentio- - uh you mentioned that there is no potential .__c3
__%__i think it's described here that the potential if you use it for the mapping to the next generation networks in the wireless access area they are still some potential to map multicast .__c3
__s:qw__because they do not use it .__c3
__s__and to figure out whether they're useful inse- - instead of using certain kind of tunneling mechanism and to set up these tunnels ==__c3
__s^aa__and have the mapping between a p. s. d. n uh telephone number or whatever kind of number they are using to i. p addresses and then there's the tunnel i. d.'s ==__c3
__s__and - and all this kind of things i think is very beneficial as well for - for telecommunication providers .__c3
__%--__as well as for i. s. p.'s .__c3
__fh|s__i - i think the potential is still there .__c3
__fh|s__you - you neglected that .__c3
__s^e__but i don't think that you are right in that sense .__c3
__fh__well think it works .__c2
__b__but uh ==__c2
__fh__yes | the mapping of course between multicasting and the u. m. t. s or - or whatever .__c2
__fh__in next generation ?__c3
__s^tc__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__that's - or c. d. m. a or whatever - that's uh yeah probably a thing that has to be find out .__c2
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__i don't know what statuses .__c2
__s^aa__maybe they already did it par- - as part of u. m. t. s .__c2
__s__i'm not sure .__c2
__b__i don't have a clue .__c2
__s^aa__i - i only know how it works on copper and like ethernet .__c2
__s^e__and on p. s p. p. p over something .__c2
__fg__and how it works like that .__c2
__b__but on the wireless i'm not sure .__c2
__s__now what do you see about the ?==__c3
__s^no__um um ==__c3
__s^cs__k. p. n interests .__c3
__s__because i believe s- - if the argument changes as follows that you are here and that you are very familiar with uh the multicast stuff and k. p. n is very interesting in u. m. t. s stuff and this is one potential target network environment we are focusing on but only for the uh i. p. layer technology then why do - the mapping of multica- - also potential mapping of multicast i think must be of major interest for them .__c3
__b__right ?__c3
__s^no__one question .__c1
__s__yes | but if - if it's available ==__c2
__b__that means ==__c2
__s__so - so if uh if it's already part of the u. m. t. s standardization then uh it's immediately finished .__c2
__s^no__like okay you can tell k. p. n well go to ericsson or nokia and buy it .__c2
__s__and if it's not in there yet well it could be a suggestion .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__and then the hardware people will make it part u- - like the etsi or whatever - where u.  - wherever u. m. t. s is standardized they will d- - well go for it .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__b__of course yeah this - this group could do that too .__c2
__s__could be .__c2
__fg__but ==__c2
__s:qw__i have a - an important doubt about the i. p availability over u. m. t. s .__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__i mean you know that the carriers and some manufacturers have done an important effort in developing this web thing .__c1
__%-__and uh | i'm not sure what they plan to do with next generation .__c1
__s__i mean are they maintaining are they holding the same web technology ?__c1
__qy^d^g^rt__or are ju- - just they - discarding this technology ?__c1
__s__and forgetting about the thing .__c1
__s^aa|sj__i - i don't know what will happen .__c1
__b__uh i - i don't have a clue .__c1
__s.%--__probably if after searching a little bit on the - on the net i can get the answer .__c1
__s^bsc^cs__but initially this is something to - to - to have in mind .__c1
__s^aa__i mean because maybe this u. m. t. s thing will appear on the market without i. p as a native protocol .__c1
__s__and if this is the case well thus seamless integration could be we- - strongly affected .__c1
__s__at least uh if you - we want to use u. m. t. s .__c1
__s__i'm - i'm - just uh throwing the question .__c1
__s^aa__uh i mean looking for an answer .__c1
__s.%-__because i don't know if uh some of you have a clue about this .__c1
__fh__i don't know what - what carriers are planning to do about this .__c1
__s^na__i'm not really sure .__c2
__%-__but i thought i - i had the impression that we can throw away our nokia stuff when our web gateways when we g- - even go to g. p. r. s .__c2
__s__so ==__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__let alone u. m. t. s .__c2
__s__now wap is ja not only related now to available bandwidth .__c3
__fh|s__that's the impression i get .__c2
__sj__that's not the only thing .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__it's only the adaptation towards the capabilities of the end device .__c3
__s__right ?__c3
__b__yeah | definitely .__c2
__fg|s^nd__so ==__c3
__s.%--__uh - i never was a friend ==__c3
__s.%--__but but still a le- - d- - it's a - it's a fundamental ==__c2
__b__huh .__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^cs__uh it's a - part of a - of design like the - the ==__c2
__s^aa__the terminal has a wap stick .__c2
__s^aa^r__and there's a box that has also a - a wap stick .__c2
__s.%--__so yeah .__c3
__s__and they do sometime - most cases they do share an i. p address .__c2
__s^bk__but doesn't uh have to deal with i. p at all .__c2
__s^bk__it's l- - just a thirty bit number .__c2
__s^df__uhhuh .__c1
__b__that a- - actually is an assigned number .__c2
__s__but it's all only used for identification .__c2
__sj__that's the only thing .__c2
__s^df__it's stored in a wap cookie .__c2
__b^rt__much like h. t. p .__c2
__b__in a cookie and from the wap gateway ==__c2
__fh|s^cs__then it will be h. t. p - real h. t. p - or something .__c2
__s^aa__so it's - it's really a different uh type of connection .__c2
__s^e__it looks a little bit like uh the - the well w. m. l looks a little bit like h. t. m. l .__c2
__b__but that's all what's uh ==__c2
__fh|s__it's not i. p at all .__c2
__s__right .__c3
__b__because there is a gateway you can access with almost the same microbrowser .__c2
__s__the same i- - uh web servers .__c2
__s.%-__if they provide the right content - uh spit out the right uh w. m. l language .__c2
__s^bs__so it's - it's really a different network - technology - i think .__c2
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__sj__it's transparent in principle what you can carry .__c3
__s^aa__but ==__c3
__s^aa__anyway you have the gateway .__c3
__s^am__it must be uh the ca- - uh c- - uh t- - conversion of the media .__c3
__fh__yeah .__c2
__fh__but @@ ==__c2
__s^cs.%--__@@ of the contents in principle .__c3
__sj.%--__but i don't see that uh ==__c3
__s__it's too late i believe .__c3
__b__if wap was available in the beginning of g. s. m then i think it was there would be a good chance that it is well deployed .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__b__but now the first generation of web-browsers are in the ha- - and - and uh i would say handies .__c3
__b__i- - i- ==__c2
__b__so that's wrong - in the mobile phones .__c3
__fh|s^rt__but the - the next generation of networks are still available .__c3
__fh|s__and the ba- - uh the bandwidth constraints are no more applicable .__c3
__fh|s.%--__well ==__c2
__fh|s.%--__ri- - right now there is still a lot of wap actually .__c2
__b__and ==__c3
__b__so that the ==__c2
__fh|s__uhhuh .__c1
__sj__yeah | but - the hype .__c3
__sj__but ==__c3
__s^df__pffft ==__c3
__sj__uh ==__c3
__fh__well users - usage .__c2
__s^no__i never saw a user using wap .__c3
__fh__please raise your hand who is using wap .__c3
__fg__my colleagues are .__c2
__s__yeah ?__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s:qw__yeah | they are using wap .__c2
__s:qy__yeah ?__c3
__b__okay | one of six .__c3
__s.%--:qy.%--__so ==__c3
__s__i don't have a mobile phone .__c4
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__oh .__c3
__fh|sj.%--__i- ==__c2
__b.%__who is using mobile phones ?__c0
__s^no__bu- - well you don't have a mobile phone in - in the u. s. a here .__c2
__%-__no .__c1
__sj__no .__c1
__s__so that's maybe the reason .__c2
__b__not me .__c1
__s__and i'm not - i doubt that it's not available in germany .__c2
__%-__it's - would be unbelievable to me .__c2
__fg|s.%-__now do you - yeah do you see the chance for wap ?__c3
__s^aa__i don't see it .__c3
__s^aa__it i- - it is .__c2
__b__in - in - in sweden it is also there .__c2
__fh|s^rt__and in the netherlands it is also available .__c2
__b__huh .__c1
__%--__every provider provides ==__c2
__fh|s__in spain it's available .__c1
__s__but uh you know uh my main complaint has been all the time that it is difficult to me to believe that i can do interesting work with a 4 lines display .__c1
__fh__uh maybe check the lottery result or something like this .__c1
__fh__oh .__c2
__s__yeah | but ==__c2
__fh|s__oh !__c2
__fh__bu- ==__c2
__qy^rt^t^tc__i'm the first one to admit that's a h- - that it is a hype .__c2
__s^aa__but ==__c1
__s^df^rt__but - and - but i'm - i just wanted to say it is being used .__c2
__s^co__but if it makes sense to me and to - especially to have wap in - in between no .__c2
____i'm not a supporter of it .__c2
____huh huh-huh .__c1
____so they have this optimized protocol to - to transmit a few ascii bytes that can rescr- - refresh the screen with a different animation every well second a few times .__c2
____yeah .__c3
____so that's - that's true .__c2
__z__i immediately agree .__c2
__z__but the thing was y- - you just asked well will - will it be the same will there be wap for u. m. t. s and so on q. p. r. s .__c2
__z__well ==__c1
