__z__uh is it the twenty fourth ?__c2
__z__now we're on .__c5
__z__yeah .__c2
__z__uh chuck is the mike type wireless ==__c0
__z__yes .__c5
__z__wireless headset ?__c0
__s__yes .__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__okay .__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__fg__for you it is .__c5
__s__yeah .__c2
__fh|s^co^t__we uh - we abandoned the lapel .__c2
____because they sort of were not too - not too hot not too cold .__c2
____they were - you know they were uh far enough away that you got more background noise uh and uh - and so forth .__c2
____uhhuh .__c0
____but they weren't so close that they got quite the - you know the really good - no th- ==__c2
____okay .__c0
__z__they - i mean they didn't ==__c2
____wait a minute .__c2
____i'm saying that wrong .__c2
__fh|s^t3__they were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes .__c2
__s^t3__but on the other hand they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference .__c2
__s^bk^t3__uhhuh .__c0
__fh__so it was no - didn't seem to be a good point to them .__c2
__s__on the other hand if you only had to have one mike in some ways you could argue the lapel was a good choice .__c2
__fh__precisely because it's in the middle .__c2
__s^bk__yeah yeah .__c0
__fh|s^j__there's uh some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with the lapel .__c2
__fh__uh little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel .__c2
__fh|s^tc__but ==__c2
__b__given the choice we - there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh getting rid of lapels .__c2
__fh|s^t__so ==__c2
__fh|s^t__the mike number is ==__c0
__fh|s^co^t__uh your mike number's written on the back of that unit there .__c5
__fh|s^rt__oh yeah .__c0
__fh|s__one .__c0
__s^co^t__and then the channel number's usually one less than that .__c5
__fh__oh okay .__c0
__b__it- - it's one less than what's written on the back of your ==__c5
__fh|s^co^t__okay .__c0
__fh|s^t__okay .__c0
__s__okay .__c0
__s^co^t__yeah .__c5
__s__so you should be zero actually .__c5
__s^j__hello ?__c0
__s^bk|s__yeah .__c0
__fh__for your uh channel number .__c5
__fh|s^co^t__yep yep .__c0
__qo^d__and you should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more of your pronunciations .__c2
__fh__no they don't - don't have a - have any indian pronunciations .__c2
__qy^rt__so what we usually do is um we typically will have our meetings .__c5
__h|s^nd__yeah .__c2
__%__and then at the end of the meetings we'll read the digits .__c5
__s^co__everybody goes around and reads the digits on the - the bottom of their forms .__c5
__s^bk__session r.  ==__c2
__fh__r. nineteen ?__c3
__s__okay .__c0
__b__r. nineteen .__c2
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__we're - this is session r. nineteen .__c5
__b__if you say so .__c2
__b__okay .__c2
__s^bk__do we have anything like an agenda ?__c2
__b__what's going on ?__c2
__s__um ==__c2
__fh__i guess ==__c2
__s__um ==__c2
__fh__so ==__c2
__fh__sunil's here for the summer ?__c5
__fh__one thing ==__c2
__fg__sunil's here for the summer .__c2
__fh|s^t__right .__c2
__fh__um ==__c2
__s__so one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting .__c2
__fh__maybe .__c2
__s^bk__uh ==__c2
__fh|s^df^e__and then just uh i guess uh progress reports individually and then uh plans for where we go between now and then pretty much .__c2
__fh__um ==__c2
__fh|qw__i could say a few words about um some of the uh compute stuff that's happening around here .__c5
__fh__so that people in the group know .__c5
__qw^rt__uhhuh .__c2
__h|s__okay .__c2
__s^e__why don't you start with that ?__c2
__s^bk__that's sort of ==__c2
__fg|qy.%--__okay .__c5
__s__we um ==__c5
__fh|qw__yeah .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__so we just put in an order for about twelve new machines uh to use as sort of a compute farm .__c5
__s^aa__and um ==__c5
__s^bk__uh we ordered uh sun blade one hundreds .__c5
__s^aa__and um ==__c5
__s^aa__i'm not sure exactly how long it'll take for those to come in .__c5
__fg|s^cs__but uh in addition we're running ==__c5
__s^m__so the plan for using these is uh we're running p. make and customs here .__c5
__s^aa|s^df__and andreas has sort of gotten that all uh fixed up and up to speed .__c5
__s^bk__and he's got a number of little utilities that make it very easy to um run things using p. make and customs .__c5
__fh__you don't actually have to write p. make scripts and things like that .__c5
__s^fe__the simplest thing ==__c5
__fg__and i can send an email around .__c5
__fh__or maybe i should do an f. a. q on the web site about it or something .__c5
__qy^rt__um ==__c5
__s^aa__there's a c- ==__c5
__s^cc__how about an email that points to the f. a. q ?__c2
__fh|s^na__yeah yeah .__c5
__s__you know what i'm saying ?__c2
__fh__so that you can ==__c2
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^nd__uh there's a command uh that you can use called run command .__c5
__s^nd__run dash command .__c5
__s^nd__run hyphen command .__c5
__s^bk__and if you say that and then some job that you want to execute uh it will find the fastest currently available machine and export your job to that machine .__c5
__s__and uh - | and run it there .__c5
__s__and it'll duplicate your environment .__c5
__s^bk__so ==__c5
__s^aa__you can try this as a simple test with uh the l. s command .__c5
__s^nd__so you can say run dash command l. s .__c5
__s__and um | it'll actually export that l. s command to some machine in the institute and um do an l. s on your current directory .__c5
__b__so substitute l. s for whatever command you want to run .__c5
__s^bk__and um - | and that's a simple way to get started using - using this .__c5
__s^bk__and so soon when we get all the new machines up um e- - then we'll have lots more compute to use .__c5
__s__now th- - one of the nice things is that uh each machine that's part of the p. make and customs network has attributes associated with it .__c5
__b__uh | attributes like how much memory the machine has .__c5
__b__what its speed is .__c5
__s__what its operating system .__c5
__b__and when you use something like run command you can specify those attributes for your program .__c5
__s__for example if you only want your thing to run under linux you can give it the linux attribute .__c5
__s.%--__and then it will find the fastest available linux machine and run it on that .__c5
__fh__so ==__c5
__fh__you can control where your jobs go to a certain extent .__c5
__s^ba__all the way down to an individual machine .__c5
__fg__each machine has an attribute which is the name of itself .__c5
__s.%--__so you can give that as an attribute and it'll only run on that .__c5
__s__if there's already a job running on some machine that you're trying to select your job will get queued up .__c5
__s__and then when that resource that machine becomes available your job will get exported there .__c5
__s__so ==__c5
__s__there's a lot of nice features to it .__c5
__fh|s__and it kind of helps to balance the load of the machines .__c5
__s^bk__and uh ==__c5
__fh|s^co^j__right now andreas and i have been the main ones using it .__c5
__fh__and we're - uh ==__c5
__%-__the s. r. i recognizer has all this p. make customs stuff built into it .__c5
__s__so ==__c5
__%-__so as i understand you know he's using all the machines and you're using all the machines .__c2
__s__yeah .__c5
__s^aa__is the rough division of ==__c2
__fh__exactly .__c5
__s__yeah | you know i - i sort of got started using the recognizer just recently .__c5
__fh__and uh ==__c5
__fh__uh i fired off a training job .__c5
__s^bu__and then i fired off a recognition job .__c5
__fg__and i get this email about midnight from andreas saying uh are you running two trainings simultaneously .__c5
__s__s- - my m- - my jobs are not getting run .__c5
__s^bk__so i had to back off a little bit .__c5
__fh|s__but ==__c5
__fh|s^cc__soon as we get some more machines then uh - then we'll have more compute available .__c5
__s^j.%-__so ==__c5
__s^cs__um ==__c5
__s__that's just a quick update about what we've got .__c5
__s__um | i have - i have a question about the uh parallelization .__cb
__s__so ==__c5
__s^bk.%__uhhuh .__c5
__fh__so um | let's say i have like a thousand little - little jobs to do .__cb
__fg__uhhuh .__c5
__s__um | how do i do it with run command ?__cb
__fh|s^co__i mean do ==__cb
__fh|qw__you could write a script uh which called run command on each sub job .__c5
__s^cs__uhhuh .__cb
__h|s^rt__a thousand times ?__cb
__b__right ?__c5
__s.%--__okay .__cb
__s__but you probably want to be careful with that .__c5
__s__because um you don't want to saturate the network .__c5
__s^rt__uh ==__c5
__s__so um ==__c5
__s__you know you should - you should probably not run more than say ten jobs yourself at any one time .__c5
__s__uh just because then it would keep other people ==__c5
__s^rt__oh .__cb
__s__too much file transfer and stuff .__cb
__fh__well it's not that so much as that you know e- - with - if everybody ran fifty jobs at once then it would just bring everything to a halt .__c5
__s^bk__and you know people's jobs would get delayed .__c5
__fh__so it's sort of a sharing thing .__c5
__s__okay .__cb
__fh__um ==__c5
__s^aa__so you should try to limit it to somet- - sometim- - some number around ten jobs at a time .__c5
__fh__um ==__c5
__s.%--__so if you had a script for example that had a thousand things it needed to run um you'd somehow need to put some logic in there if you were going to use run command uh to only have ten of those going at a time .__c5
__qw^rt__and uh then when one of those finished you'd fire off another one .__c5
__qy^bu^d__um ==__c5
__%--__i remember i - i forget whether it was when the rutgers or - or hopkins workshop .__c2
__s^co.%--__i remember one of the workshops i was at there were - everybody was real excited because they got twenty five machines .__c2
__s__and there was some kind of p. make like thing that sit- - sent things out .__c2
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c5
__s^co__uhhuh .__c5
__%--__uhhuh .__c5
__h|s^aa__so all twenty five people were sending things to all twenty five machines .__c2
__b__yeah .__c5
__s^co__yeah .__c5
__s^bk^rt__and and things were a lot less efficient than if you'd just use your own machine .__c2
__s__yep .__c5
__s^aa__yeah exactly .__c5
__s^bk|s^aa__yeah you have to be a little bit careful .__c5
__b__as i recall .__c2
__s__but ==__c2
__s^co__huh .__c3
__s^e__yeah .__c2
__fh__um ==__c5
__s__but uh you can also ==__c5
__s__if you have that level of parallelization um and you don't want to have to worry about writing the logic in - in a perl script to take care of that you can use um p. make .__c5
__b__just do p. make .__cb
__s^rt__and - and you basically write a make file that uh you know your final job depends on these one thousand things .__c5
__s__s- ==__cb
__fh__uhhuh .__cb
__%__and when you run p. make uh on your make file you can give it the dash capital j.  and - and then a number .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__cb
__qy^rt__and that number represents how many uh machines to use at once .__c5
__s^aa|s__right .__cb
__s^e__and then it'll make sure that it never goes above that .__c5
__s__right .__cb
__qw^d__okay .__cb
__s__so ==__c5
__s__i can get some documentation .__c5
__s__so it - it's - it's not systematically queued .__c3
__b__i mean all the jobs are running .__c3
__s__if you launch twenty jobs they are all running .__c3
__qy^g^rt__it depends .__c5
__s^df__all right .__c3
__s^2__if you - run command that i mentioned before is - doesn't know about other things that you might be running .__c5
__fh__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk|s^nd.%--__so it would be possible to run a hundred run jobs at once .__c5
__s__right .__c3
__b__and they wouldn't know about each other .__c5
__s^bk__but if you use p. make then it knows about all the jobs that it has to run .__c5
__s.%-__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__and it can control uh how many it runs simultaneously .__c5
__s^bk__so run command doesn't use p. make | or ?==__c2
__s^bu__it uses export underlyingly .__c5
__%-__but if you ==__c5
__s^aa__i- - it's meant to be run one job at a time .__c5
__s^aa__so you could fire off a thousand of those .__c5
__qy^rt__and it doesn't know - any one of those doesn't know about the other ones that are running .__c5
__s^bk__so why would one use that rather than p. make ?__c2
__s^aa|s.%-__well if you have ==__c5
__s.%--__um ==__c5
__s^bu|qy^d^g__like for example uh if you didn't want to write a p. make script .__c5
__s^aa|s^rt__and you just had a uh - an h. t. k training job that you know is going to take uh six hours to run .__c5
__s^e__and somebody's using uh the machine you typically use .__c5
__s^e__you can say run command and your h. t. k thing .__c5
__qy^bh^rt__and it'll find another machine .__c5
__s^bk__the fastest currently available machine .__c5
__fh__and - and run your job there .__c5
__fg__now does it have the same sort of behavior as p. make ?__c2
__s.%--__which is that you know if you run something on somebody's machine and they come in and hit a key then it ==__c2
__%--__yes .__c5
__s^bu__yeah .__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__there are um ==__c5
__s__right .__c5
__qy^d^g^rt__so some of the machines at the institute um have this attribute called no evict .__c5
__s__and if you specify that in - in one of your attribute lines then it'll go to a machine which your job won't be evicted from .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__but the machines that don't have that attribute if a job gets fired up on that which could be somebody's desktop machine and - and they were at lunch .__c5
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c2
__s__they come back from lunch and they start typing on the console then your machine will get evicted - your job will get evicted from their machine and be restarted on another machine automatically .__c5
__b__so - which can cause you to lose time .__c5
__s^no__right ?__c5
__qy__if you had a two hour job and it got halfway through .__c5
__x__and then somebody came back to their machine and it got evicted .__c5
__fh|s__so if you don't want your job to run on a machine where it could be evicted then you give it the minus - the attribute you know no evict .__c5
__s^bk|%--__and it'll pick a machine that it can't be evicted from .__c5
__fh__so ==__c5
__s^cs__um | what - what about ?==__c2
__fh__i remember always used to be an issue maybe it's not anymore that if you - if something required - if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work .__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk__but if you were logged into it from home ?__c2
__fh__and you weren't hitting any keys because you were home .__c2
__qy^d__yeah .__c5
__fh__i - i'm not sure how that works .__c5
__s^aa__uh it seems like andreas did something for that .__c5
__s^na^rt__yeah .__c2
__s__huh .__c2
__%-__um ==__c5
__h|s^rt__okay .__c2
__b__we can ask him sometime .__c2
__s^e__but ==__c5
__fh__yeah .__c5
__s^cs__i don't know whether it monitors the keyboard or actually looks at the console t. t. y .__c5
__s^bk__so maybe if you echoed something to the you know dev - dev console or something .__c5
__s^bk|s^cs__you probably wouldn't ordinarily though .__c2
__s^cs^rt__yeah right ?__c2
__s^bk__huh ?__c5
__s^bk__you probably wouldn't ordinarily .__c2
__s^bk|s__i mean you sort of ==__c2
__fg|s^bs__you're at home and you're trying to log in .__c2
__s^aa__and it takes forever to even log you in .__c2
__%__yeah yeah .__c5
__s^bsc__and you probably go screw this .__c2
__s^m^na__and - you know .__c2
__s^aa__yeah .__c5
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__fg|s__so um ==__c5
__s^cs__yeah .__c2
__s^cs^df__yeah .__c5
__b__i - i can - i'm not sure about that one .__c5
__%-__yeah .__c2
__s^cs^rt__but uh ==__c5
__s^df__okay .__c2
__fg|s^aap__uh i need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr- - s- - how to run some jobs here .__c0
__s.%-__because i never d- - did anything so far with this x.  emissions .__c0
__s^nd__okay .__c5
__b__so ==__c0
__s^df__i think maybe i'll ask you after the meeting .__c0
__qy^d^f^g^rt__um ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c5
__b__yeah and - and also uh stephane's a - a really good resource for that if you can't find me .__c5
__s^nd__yeah yeah yeah .__c0
__s^bk__yep .__c0
__fh__okay .__c0
__s^t3__sure @@ .__c0
__%__huh .__c3

__s__uh ==__c0
__s__are y- - are you saying l. d. a ?__c5
__s__yeah .__c0
__s^cs__l. d. a .__c5
__s__okay .__c5
__s__yeah .__c0
__fh|s__so ==__c0
__fh|s__just - just the l. d. a filters .__c0
__s^bk__i just plug in - i just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in l. d. a on top of that .__c0
__fh__uhhuh .__c5
__fh|s__but the l. d. a filter that i used was different from what we submitted in the proposal .__c0
__s__what i did was i took the l. d. a filter's design using clean speech .__c0
__s__uh | mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement .__c0
__s^e^rt__so instead of using this uh narrow - narrow band l. d. a filter that we submitted uh i got new filters .__c0
__s^cs__so ==__c0
__s^t3__that seems to be giving - uh improving over their uh system .__c0
__fh__slightly .__c0
__s^bk__but not very significantly .__c0
__fh__and uh that was ==__c0

__s.%--__BLEEPED__cb
__s__uh showing any improvement over - final - by plugging in an l. d. a .__c0
__b__and uh ==__c0
__fh|qw__so then after - after that i - i added uh online normalization also on top of that .__c0
__qy^d^f^g^rt__and that - there - there also i n- - i found that i have to make some changes to their time constant that i used .__c0
__fh|s__because th- - it has a - a mean and variance update time constant .__c0
__s__and - which is not suitable for the enhanced speech and whatever we try it on with proposal one .__c0
__s^df__but um ==__c0
__%__i didn't - i didn't play with that time constant a lot .__c0
__s^cs__i just t- - g- ==__c0
__fh__i just found that i have to reduce the value .__c0
__b__i mean i have to increase the time constant or reduce the value of the update value .__c0
__s^am__that's all i found .__c0
__b__so i have to ==__c0
__b__uh ==__c0
__b__yeah .__c0
__s__and uh ==__c0
__s__uh the other - other thing what i tried was i just um uh took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf- - uh th- - information .__c0
__fg|s__just the aurora baseline .__c0
__s__to see that how much the baseline itself improves .__c0
__s^bk__by just supplying the information of the - i mean the w- - speech and nonspeech .__c0
__fh__and uh ==__c0
__fh__i found that the baseline itself improves by twenty two percent by just giving the wuh- ==__c0
__fh|s__uh can you back up a second ?__c2
__fh|s__i - i - i missed something .__c2
__s__uh ==__c2
__s^bu__i guess my mind wandered .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__ad- - ad- - when you added the online normalization and so forth uh uh things got better again ?__c2
__%--__yeah .__c0
__%--__or is it ?==__c2
__s^no__no .__c0
__s__no .__c0
__s.%--__did it not ?__c2
__b__no things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used .__c0
__b__no no .__c2
__fh__with a different time constant .__c2
__%--__with the different time constant i found that ==__c0
__s^bk__i mean i didn't get an improvement over not using online normalization .__c0
__s^co^t^tc__oh .__c2
__s^bk__no you didn't .__c2
__s^bk__because i - i found that i would have change the value of the update factor .__c0
__h|s__okay .__c2
__s__but i didn't play it with - play - play quite a bit to make it better than ==__c0
__fh|s__yeah .__c2
__s^e__okay .__c2
__s^ba__so it's still not .__c0
__s^bk__i mean the online normalization didn't give me any improvement .__c0
__fh__okay .__c2
__s^e__and uh ==__c0
__fh|s__okay .__c2
__s__so ==__c0
__s^e__oh yeah .__c0
__fh__so i just stopped there with the uh speech enhancement .__c0
__%-__the - the other thing what i tried was the - adding the uh endpoint information to the baseline .__c0
__qy^j^rt__and that itself gives like twenty two percent .__c0
__s^j__because the - the second - the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech .__c0
__s^aa__and just to get a feel of how much the baseline itself is going to change by adding this endpoint information i just uh use ==__c0
__fg|s^rt__huh .__c2
__fh|s^e__so people won't even have to worry about uh doing speech-nonspeech then .__c5
__b__yeah .__c0
__fh|s__that's that's what the feeling is like .__c0
__qy^bu^d__huh .__c5
__fh.%__they're going to give the endpoint information .__c0
__s^aa__i see .__c5
__fh__g- - i guess the issue is that people do that anyway .__c2
__s^e__everybody does that .__c2
__b__and they wanted to see given that you're doing that what - what are the best features that you should use .__c2
__s__yeah .__c0
__%__yeah .__c5
__s^e__i see .__c5
__b__so ==__c0
__s^bk|s^bu__i mean clearly they're interact .__c2
__s^aa__so i don't know that i entirely agree with it .__c2
__qy^d^g__yeah .__c5
__qy^bu^d^e^rt__but - but it might be uh - in some ways it might be better t- - to - rather than giving the endpoints to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with .__c2
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bk__but you know it's - it's still someth- - reasonable .__c2
__h|s^no__so are people supposed to assume that there is uh ?==__c5
__s^na__are - are people not supposed to use any speech outside of those endpoints ?__c5
__b__uh ==__c0
__b__or can you then use speech outside of it for estimating background noise and things ?__c5
__fg__no .__c0
__fh|s^bu__no .__c0
__s^bu__that i- - i ==__c0
__s.%--__yeah .__c0
__b.x__yeah yeah .__c0
__s__exactly .__c0
__b.x__i guess that is - that is where the consensus is .__c0
__s^bk__like y- - you will - you will - you'll be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech .__c0
__b.x__but the whole speech is available to you .__c0
__s__okay .__c5
__b.x__so ==__c0
__fg__so it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better .__c2
__s^am__because you don't have the mistakes in it .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c0
__fg__yeah ?__c2
__b__okay .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c0
__s__so ==__c0
__fh|s__so that - that - the baseline itself ==__c0
__%-__i mean it improves by twenty two percent .__c0
__s^cs__i found that in s- - one of the speechdat-car cases that like the spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint .__c0
__s.%--__wow .__c5
__s__w- ==__c0
__s^aa__i mean you don't need any further speech enhancement with fifty .__c0
__s^bk__so uh ==__c0
__%__so the baseline itself improves by fifty percent .__c5
__qw__yeah | by fifty percent .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__s^bk|s__so it's g- - it's going to be harder to beat that actually .__c2
__s^bk__wow .__c5
__qy^rt__yeah .__c5
__h|s.%-__yeah .__c0
__qrr__but - but ==__c2
__s^aa__so ==__c0
__s__so that is when uh the - the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty five percent for well matched .__c0
__s^bk__and i think they have - they have actually changed their qualification c- - criteria now .__c0
__fg|qw__and uh ==__c0
__h|s__yeah .__c0
__s^bk__i guess after that i just went home f- - i just had a vacation fo- - for four weeks .__c0
__b__okay .__c2
__b__uh ==__c0
__%__no that's - that's - that's a good - good update .__c2
__s.%--__ye- ==__c0
__b__yeah .__c0
__s__and i - i came back and i started working on uh some other speech enhancement algorithm .__c0
__s^aa__i mean so - i - from the submission what i found that people have tried spectral subtraction and wiener filtering these are the main uh approaches where people have tried .__c0
__s^na__yeah .__c2
__s__so just to - just to fill the space with some f- - few more speech enhancement algorithms to see whether it improves a lot i - i've been working on this uh signal subspace approach for speech enhancement .__c0
__b__where you take the noisy signal and then decomposing the signal s- - and the noise subspace .__c0
__s.%--__and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal plus noise subspace .__c0
__%-__uhhuh .__c2
__s^bk__and ==__c0
__s__so i've been actually running some s- ==__c0
__s^aa__so far i've been trying it only on matlab .__c0
__s__i have to - to - to test whether it works first or not .__c0
__s^bk|s^df__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__and then i'll p- - port it to c.  .__c0
__s__and i'll update it with the repository once i find it- - it giving any some positive result .__c0
__b.%__so yeah .__c0
__fg__s- ==__c2
__s__so you s- - you - so you said one thing i want to jump on for a second .__c2
__s__so - so now you're - you're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here .__c2
__fh|s__yeah .__c0
__s__and - so we- - we'll have a single place where the stuff is .__c2
__fh|s__yep .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c0
__s.%--__cool .__c2
__s^aa__um ==__c2
__qr__so maybe uh just briefly you could remind us about the related experiments .__c2
__fh|s__because you did some stuff that you talked about last week .__c2
__b__i guess ?__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__b__um | where you were also combining something ==__c2
__s.%-__both of you i guess were both combining something from the uh french telecom system with the u- - uh ==__c2
__b__right .__c3
__qw__i - i don't know whether it was system one or system two .__c2
__h|qy^bu^d^rt__or ==__c2
__s^ar|s^nd__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk__it was system one .__c3
__fh|s^bk__so ==__c3
__s__okay .__c2
__s^t3__we ==__c3
__s^bk__the main thing that we did is just to take the spectral subtraction from the france telecom .__c3
__s^bk__which provide us some speech samples that are uh with noise removed .__c3
__s^rt__so i let me - let me just stop you there .__c2
__qy__so then one distinction is that uh you were taking the actual france telecom features and then applying something to ==__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__uh | no .__c0
__s^aa__there is a slight different .__c0
__s^m^na__uh ==__c0
__s^bk__BLEEPED__c0
__s^bk__BLEEPED__c1
__fh__BLEEPED__c2
__s__BLEEPED__c3
__fh__BLEEPED__c4
__s__BLEEPED__c5
__b__BLEEPED__cb
__s__i mean which are extracted at the handset .__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__because they had another back end blind equalization .__c0
__b__yeah .__c2
__b__but that's what i mean .__c2
__s^bu__yeah .__c0
__h|s^aa__yeah .__c0
__s^m^na__but u- - u- ==__c2
__s^bk__sorry .__c2
__s^aa__yeah i'm not being - i'm not being clear .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c0
__s^rt__yeah .__c0
__s^aa__what i meant was you had something like cepstra or something | right ?__c2
__s__yeah yeah yeah yeah .__c0
__s^bk__and so one difference is that i guess you were taking spectra .__c2
__s^e__the speech .__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__but i guess it's the s- - exactly the same thing .__c3
__b__because on the heads- - uh handset they just applied this wiener filter and then compute cepstral features .__c3
__qy^rt__right ?__c3
__s^e__yeah .__c0
__s^e__or ?==__c3
__s^bk__the cepstral f- - the difference is like - there may be a slight difference in the way .__c0
__qy^bu__because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech .__c0
__s^aa__right .__c3
__s^no__i mean if we are using our own code for th- - i mean that - that could be the only difference .__c0
__%-__i mean there is no other difference .__c0
__fg|s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__yeah .__c0
__s^aa__but you got some sort of different result .__c2
__s__so i'm trying to understand it .__c2
__s^bk__but uh ==__c2
__s__yeah | well i think we should uh have a table with all the result .__c3
__s__i th- ==__c2
__b__because i don't know - i uh - i don't exactly know what are your results .__c3
__s^bk|s__but ==__c3
__s__okay .__c0
__s^bk__okay .__c0
__b__huh .__c3
__s__yeah | but so we did this .__c3
__s__and another difference i guess is that we just applied uh proposal one system after this .__c3
__s__without - well with our modification to reduce the delay of the - the l. d. a filters .__c3
__s^e__and ==__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__fh__well there are slight modifications .__c3
__s^bu|qy^d^g^rt__and the filter ==__c1
__s^no__but it was the full proposal one .__c3
__s^bk__in your case if you tried just putting l. d. a then maybe online normalization .__c3
__s^bu__only l. d. a .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__af- - i - after that i added online normalization .__c0
__fh|s__yeah .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__so we just tried directly to - to just keep the system as it was .__c3
__s__and ==__c3
__%--__um ==__c3
__qy^co^rt__when we plug the spectral subtraction it improves uh signif- - significantly .__c3
__s^aa__um ==__c3
__%-__but what seems clear also is that we have to retune the time constants of the online normalization .__c3
__s^na__yeah yeah .__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c0
__s^e__because if we keep the value that was submitted uh it doesn't help at all .__c3
__s^aa__you can remove online normalization or put it it doesn't change anything .__c3
__s^cs__uh uh as long as you have the spectral subtraction .__c3
__s^aa__but you can still find some kind of optimum somewhere .__c3
__s^aa__and we don't know where exactly .__c3
__fh__but ==__c3
__s^bk__yeah .__c0
__fg__uh ==__c3
__fg|qy^t3__yeah i assume .__c0
__s.%--__so it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something .__c2
__s__right .__c3
__s__and see where i- - where the - where they were different and what we can learn from it .__c2
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^e__yeah .__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bu__uhhuh .__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__BLEEPED__c0
__s^aa__BLEEPED__c1
__s^na__BLEEPED__c2
__s^bk__BLEEPED__c3
__s__BLEEPED__c4
__s^bk__BLEEPED__c5
__qy^bu^rt__BLEEPED__cb
__s^ar__without any change .__c0
__fg__yeah .__c3
__fg__but it's ==__c1
__s^nd__okay .__c0
__fg__well .__c3
__%__it's the new .__c1
__s^e__with - with - with changes .__c3
__%--__with ==__c0
__s__the new .__c1
__s^e__because we change it the system to have ==__c3
__s^e^rt__oh yeah .__c0
__s^e__i mean the - the new l. d. a filters .__c0
__fh__the new .__c1
__fh__i mean ==__c0
__s^e.%-__yeah .__c3
__fg|s.%--__okay .__c0
__s^bk|s^bu__l. d. a filters .__c3
__qy^d^g__there are other things that we finally were shown to improve also .__c3
__s__like the sixty four hertz cutoff .__c3
__s^bu__uhhuh .__c1
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c0
__s^e__w- - uh it doesn't seem to hurt on t. i. digits finally .__c3
__s^e__okay .__c0
__s^bk__maybe because of other changes .__c3
__s__okay .__c0
__s^cs__um ==__c3
__fh__well there are some minor changes .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^co.%-__uhhuh .__c0
__s^rt__and right now if we look at the results it's um always better than - it seems always better than france telecom for mismatch and high mismatch .__c3
__qy^br^d^rt__and it's still slightly worse for well matched .__c3
__s^rt__um ==__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__but ==__c1
__s^bk__but this is not significant .__c3
__s^rt__but the problem is that it's not significant .__c3
__s^m__but if you put this in the huh uh spreadsheet it's still worse .__c3
__fh|s__even with very minor ==__c3
__s^m^rt__uh ==__c3
__s__even if it's only slightly worse for well matched .__c3
__s^m^rt__uhhuh .__c2
__fh__and significantly better for h. m .__c3
__s__uh ==__c3
__s^m^rt__but well .__c3
__s__i don't think it's importa- - important .__c3
__s^bk__because when they will change their metric ==__c3
__s^bu|qy^d^g^rt__uh ==__c3
__%-__uh mainly because of uh when you p- - you plug the um frame dropping in the baseline system it will improve a lot h. m and m. m .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c0
__b__so ==__c3
__s^cs__um | i guess what will happen ==__c3
__b__i don't know what will happen .__c3
__fh__but the different contribution i think for the different test set will be more even .__c3
__s^cs__because the - your improvement on h. m and m. m will also go down significantly in the spreadsheet .__c0
__s^rt__so ==__c0
__fh__but the the well matched may still ==__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__i mean the well matched may be the one which is least affected by adding the endpoint information .__c0
__fh__right .__c2
__qw__yeah .__c0
__s^bk.%--__so the ==__c0
__qy.%--__the m. m ==__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bu__m. m and h. m are going to be v- - hugely affected by it .__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__so um ==__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__yeah .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c0
__h__but they d- - the - everything i mean is like ==__c0
__fh__but there ==__c0
__s^nd__that's how they reduce - why they reduce the qualification to twenty five percent or some - something on .__c0
__%__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk__but are they changing the weighting ?__c2
__fh__uh | no .__c0
__s^cs__i guess they are going ahead with the same weighting .__c0
__s^cs.%-__yeah .__c3
__s^na__yeah .__c0
__s^df__so there's nothing on ==__c0
__b__i don't understand that .__c2
__b__i guess i - i haven't been part of the discussion .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c0
__s^df__so um ==__c2
__s^cs__it seems to me that the well matched condition is going to be unusual .__c2
__s^2.%-__in this case .__c2
__s^aa__usual .__c0
__s^e__unusual .__c2
__s^cs^e__uhhuh .__c0
__b__because um you don't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any @@ - particular person's car is like .__c2
__b__or ==__c2
__s__huh .__c0
__s^bk__uh ==__c2
__fh|s^e__huh .__c0
__s__it seems like something like the middle one is - is more natural .__c2
__s__huh .__c0
__fg|s__so i don't know why the well matched is ==__c2
__s^e__right .__c0
__b__uh ==__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__fh|s__yeah | but actually the well - well - the well matched ==__c0
__s^rt^tc__um ==__c0
__s^bk__uh ==__c0
__fh|s__i mean the - the well matched condition is not like uh the one in t. i. digits .__c0
__fh|s^e__where uh you have all the training uh conditions exactly like replicated in the testing condition also .__c0
__s^e__it's like this is not calibrated by s. n. r or something .__c0
__fh|s^e__the well matched has also some - some mismatch in that which is other than the ==__c0
__qw__the well wa- - matched has mismatch ?__c2
__s__has - has also some slight mismatches .__c0
__s^m^na__unlike the t. i. digits where it's like perfectly matched .__c0
__s__perfect to match .__c5
__qw^rt__yeah .__c2
__s^ar__because it's artificially added noise .__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah .__c2
__s^ar__but this is natural recording .__c0
__s^bk__so remind me of what well matched meant .__c2
__s^m__you've told me many times .__c2
__s^aa__the - the well matched is like ==__c0
__s__the - the well matched is defined like it's seventy percent of the whole database is used for training and thirty percent for testing .__c0
__s.%__yeah .__c3
__qy^rt__well so it means that if the database is large enough it's matched .__c3
__qrr.%--__it's - it's ==__c0
__qr^bu^d^rt^t3__because it ==__c3
__s^t3__okay .__c0
__qw.%-__it's ==__c0
__s^na__yeah .__c2
__s^aa^t3__in each set you have a range of conditions .__c3
__s^e__well ==__c3
__fh__right .__c2
__s^bk__so i mean ==__c2
__s__yeah | unless they deliberately chose it to be different which they didn't because they want it to be well matched .__c2
__s__it is pretty much .__c2
__s^bk__you know so it's - so it's sort of saying if you ==__c2
__fh__it's - it's not guaranteed though .__c5
__fh__yeah .__c0
__s^bk__uh | it's not guaranteed .__c2
__qr__yeah .__c0
__fh.%__right .__c2
__%-__uhhuh .__c3
__s__right .__c2
__s__yeah because the m- - the main - major reason for the m- ==__c0
__s^j__the main mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database actually .__c0
__b__again if you have enough - if you have enough ==__c2
__s__no- ==__c0
__s__yeah yeah .__c0
__s^e__yeah .__c0
__s__so it's sort of i- - i- - it's sort of saying okay .__c2
__b__so you - much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer um you - you have a car .__c2
__s.%-__and so you drive it around a bunch and - and record noise conditions or something .__c2
__s^aa__and then - i don't think that's very realistic .__c2
__s^am__i mean i th- ==__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__s^aa__i - i you know .__c2
__s__so i ==__c2
__s.%--__i - i - you know .__c2
__s__i guess they're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars .__c2
__b.%__and - and you would have something that was roughly similar .__c2
__s^na__and maybe that's the argument .__c2
__s^aa.%--__but i'm not sure i buy it .__c2
__s^aa__so ==__c2
__s^j__yeah yeah yeah .__c0
__fh__uh ==__c2
__fh__so ==__c2
__s^tc__what else is going on ?__c2
__s^bu__huh .__c3
__s^rt__you- ==__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__yeah .__c3
__s^m__we are playing - we are also playing trying to put other spectral subtraction huh in the code .__c3
__s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt__um ==__c3
__s__it would be a very simple spectral subtraction on the um mel energies .__c3
__qw__which i already tested but without the um frame dropping actually .__c3
__h|s.%--__and i think it's important to have frame dropping if you use spectral subtraction .__c3
__s__is it - is spectral subtraction typically done on the - after the mel uh scaling ?__c5
__b__or is it done on the f. f. t bins ?__c5
__s^bk__um ==__c3
__fh|s__does it matter ?__c5
__b__or ?==__c5
__s^bk__i d- ==__c3
__b__i don't know .__c3
__s^bu__well it's both - both uh cases can i- ==__c3
__s^aa__oh .__c5
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__fh__so- - some of the proposal uh we're doing this on the bin - on the f. f. t bins .__c3
__s^bk__huh .__c5
__s__others on the um mel energies .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__you can do both .__c3
__s^ar__but i cannot tell you what's - which one might be better .__c3
__s^ar__or ==__c3
__s^nd__huh .__c5
__s^ar__i ==__c3
__s__i guess if you want to reconstruct the speech it may be a good idea to do it on f. f. t bins .__c0
__s.%--__i don't know .__c3
__s__huh .__c5
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__but ==__c3
__qy__but for speech recognition it may not .__c0
__qrr__i mean it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on f. f. t .__c0
__s^na__i see .__c5
__b__so you're going to do a linear weighting anyway after that .__c0
__s^bu^na__well .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__yeah .__c0
__%-__huh .__c5
__s^aa__so it may not be really a big different .__c0
__s^cs__well it gives something different .__c3
__s__but i don't know what are the pros and cons of both .__c3
__s.%--__it- ==__c0
__qy^bu^rt__i- - uhhuh .__c0
__qrr.%-__huh .__c2
__s^ar__so ==__c0
__s^bk^m__okay .__c2
__s^ar^r__the other thing is like when you're putting in a speech enhancement technique .__c0
__s__uh ==__c0
__s__is it like one stage speech enhancement ?__c0
__s^bk__because everybody seems to have a mod- - two stages of speech enhancement in all the proposals .__c0
__s^m__which is really giving them some improvement .__c0
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^bk^m__uhhuh .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__BLEEPED__c0
__s__BLEEPED__c1
__b__BLEEPED__c2
__fg__BLEEPED__c3
__s^ar|s__BLEEPED__c4
__s^bk__BLEEPED__c5
__s^bk^m__BLEEPED__cb
__s^bk__i mean they just do the same thing again once more .__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c2
__b__BLEEPED__c0
__s__BLEEPED__c1
__s^2__BLEEPED__c2
__s__BLEEPED__c3
__s.%--__BLEEPED__c4
__s^j__BLEEPED__c5
__s^j__BLEEPED__cb
__qy__and - so there's something that is good about doing it .__c0
__b__i mean to cleaning it up once more .__c0
__b__yeah | it might be .__c3
__fg__yeah .__c3
__fg__yeah .__c0
__s__so we can ==__c0
__fh__so maybe in my implementation i should also try to inspire me from this kind of thing .__c3
__s__yeah .__c0
__fh|s^bu__that's what ==__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__and - yeah .__c3
__s^arp__well the other thing would be to combine what you're doing .__c2
__%__i mean maybe one or - one or the other of the things that you're doing would benefit from the other happening first .__c2
__b__that's wh- ==__c0
__b__yeah .__c0
__s^bk__so ==__c0
__s__right ?__c2
__s^bk__so he's doing a signal subspace thing .__c2
__s__maybe it would work better if you'd already done some simple spectral subtraction .__c2
__s^bu__or maybe vi- - maybe the other way around .__c2
__s^na__yeah .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk^m__yeah .__c0
__fh__you know ?__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s__so i've been thinking about combining the wiener filtering with signal subspace .__c0
__s^e__i mean just to see all - some - some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not .__c0
__s^df__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__uhhuh .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__b__how is it ?==__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__i - i guess i'm ignorant about this .__c2
__h|s__how does ?==__c2
__fh|s__i mean since wiener filter also assumes that you're - that you're adding together the two signals how is - how is that differ from signal subspace ?__c2
__s^2__the signal subspace ?__c0
__fh|s^bu__yeah .__c2
__qy^d^g__the ==__c0
__s^na__the signal subspace approach has actually an in built wiener filtering in it .__c0
__h__oh okay .__c2
__s^aa__yeah .__c0
__s^bu^na__it is like a k. l transform followed by a wiener filter .__c0
__s^aa__is the signal is - is a signal substrate .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__oh oh okay .__c2
__s^aa__so the difference is the k. l .__c2
__%--__so the - the different ==__c0
__fg__the c- - the - the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the s. n. r is very bad .__c0
__s^cs__it's ==__c0
__s^bk__i see .__c2
__%__it works very poorly with the poor s. n. r conditions and in colored noise .__c0
__s^bk__so essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction followed by a k. l transform followed by a ==__c2
__s^cs^na__wiener filtering .__c0
__b__wiener filter .__c2
__s^cs__it's a - it's a cascade of two s- ==__c0
__s^bk__yeah | in general you don't ==__c2
__s^bk__that's right .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__you don't want to othorg- - orthogonalize if the things are noisy .__c2
__s^nd__actually .__c2
__fh__um | that was something that uh herve and i were talking about with um the multi band stuff .__c2
__s^aa__that if you're converting things to - from uh bands groups of bands into cepstral coef- - you know local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it's not that great to do it if it's noisy .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__s^m^na__okay .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c0
__s__uh ==__c2
__s__so ==__c2
__fh__so ==__c0
__fg__so that - that's one reason maybe we could combine .__c0
__fh__s- - some - something to improve s. n. r a little bit first stage .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s^co__and then do a something in the second stage .__c0
__s__which could take it further .__c0
__s__what was your point about - about colored noise there ?__c3
__fh__oh | the colored noise ==__c0
__s.%-__yeah .__c3
__s__uh ==__c0
__s__the colored noise - the - the v- - the signal subspace approach has - i mean it - it actually depends on inverting the matrices .__c0
__qw^rt__so it - it - ac- ==__c0
__qw^br^rt__the covariance matrix of the noise .__c0
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c3
__qh^j^rt__so if - if it is not positive definite ==__c0
__s^ar__i mean it has a - it's ==__c0
__s^df__it doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite .__c0
__%--__ak- ==__c0
__fg__it works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite .__c0
__s^t3__so you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise .__c2
__s.%--__so the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering .__c0
__b__first of the colo- - colored noise .__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__fh__and then make the noise white .__c0
__s^e__yeah .__c2
__s__and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back you do this filtering again .__c0
__s__yeah right .__c3
__s^e__i was only half kidding .__c2
__s^e__i mean if you - sort of you do the s- - spectral subtraction that also gets rid ==__c2
__s^e__yeah .__c3
__qy^rt__yeah .__c0
__h__yeah .__c0
__s.%--__and then you - then - then add a little bit l- - noise - noise addition .__c2
__s^ar^r__i mean that sort of what j.  - j. rasta does in a way .__c2
__s^ar__if you look at what j. rasta doing essentially i- - i- - it's equivalent to sort of adding a little - adding a little noise .__c2
__s^df__yeah .__c0
__fg__huh .__c0
__fh__uhhuh .__c0
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c3
__qw__in order to get rid of the effects of noise .__c2
__s^df__so ==__c0
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^e__okay .__c2
__s^e__uh yeah .__c3
__s^e.%--__so there is this .__c3
__s__and ==__c3
__s__maybe we ==__c3
__s__well we find some people so that uh agree to maybe work with us .__c3
__s__and they have implementation of v. t. s techniques .__c3
__qw__so it's um vector taylor series that are used to huh uh f- - to model the transformation between clean cepstra and noisy cepstra .__c3
__b__so well .__c3
__s^ba__if you take the standard model of channel plus noise uh it's - it's a nonlinear uh- - uh transformation in the cepstral domain .__c3
__qw^cs__uhhuh .__c2
__s^bk__yes .__c2
__s^bk__and ==__c3
__s.%--__uh there is a way to approximate this using uh first order or second order taylor series .__c3
__s.%--__and ==__c3
__s^bk__it can be used for uh getting rid of the noise and the channel effect .__c3
__s^bk__who is doing this ?__c2
__s^fe__uh w- - working in the cepstral domain ?__c3
__s^ba__so there is one guy in grenada .__c3
__s__yeah | in grenada .__c1
__s^bk^rt__and another in uh lucent that i met at i. cassp .__c3
__fh__one of my friend .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__uh ==__c3
__s^cs^nd__who's the guy in grenada ?__c2
__s^ar__uh | jose carlos segura .__c1
__s^nd__i don't know him .__c2
__s.%__this v. t. s has been proposed by c. m. u ?__c0
__%__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk__is it - is it the c. m. u ?__c0
__s^bk__yeah yeah yeah .__c1
__fg__yeah yeah okay .__c0
__fg__originally the idea was from c. m. u .__c1
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__from c.  ==__c0
__s^t1__yeah .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__fh__well it's again a different thing that could be tried .__c3
__s^bu__um ==__c3
__%-__uhhuh .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__huh yeah .__c3
__qw^br^rt__yeah | so at any rate you're looking general uh standing back from it looking at ways to combine one form or another of uh noise removal uh with - with these other things we have .__c2
__s^bu^r__uhhuh .__c3
__s^ar__uh | looks like a worthy thing to - to do here .__c2
__qy^d^g^r^rt__uh yeah .__c3
__s^bk__but yeah .__c3
__s^nd__but for sure there's required to - that requires to re check everything else and re-optimize the other things .__c3
__fh__oh yeah .__c2
__%--__and ==__c3
__qy^d.%-__for sure the online normalization may be the l. d. a filter .__c3
__fh__um ==__c3
__s^bk__well one of the - seems like one of the things to go through next week when hari's here .__c2
__s^co__i ==__c3
__s^df__because hari will have his own ideas too .__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__or i guess not next week .__c2
__fh__week and a half .__c2
__s^rt__uh | will be sort of go through these alternatives .__c2
__qy__what we've seen so far .__c2
__fg__and come up with some game plans .__c2
__fh__um ==__c2
__s__you know .__c2
__s^ar__so i mean one way would ==__c2
__s^bu__he- - here are some alternate visions .__c2
__qy^bu^rt__i mean one would be you look at a few things very quickly .__c2
__qrr.%--__you pick on something that looks like it's promising .__c2
__h|s^nd__and then everybody works really hard on the same - different aspects of the same thing .__c2
__s^bu__another thing would be to have t- - to - to pick two pol- - two plausible things .__c2
__qy^g^rt__and - and you know have t- - sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what's better .__c2
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c3
__s.%--__and then ==__c2
__qw^br^d^rt__you know .__c2
__qy^bu^r^rt__uh ==__c2
__s^bk__but w- - um ==__c2
__s^bu__uh | he'll have some ideas on that too .__c2
__qy^g^rt__the other thing is to uh - most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks .__c0
__s^ar__but we - we going to address this wall street journal in our next stage .__c0
__fh__which is also going to be a noisy task .__c0
__s^nd^rt__so s- - very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all .__c0
__s^e__so there are some ==__c0
__qy^d^f^g__i mean i was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks .__c0
__s^e__and ==__c0
__s^e__spectral subtraction doesn't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks .__c0
__fh__and it's ==__c0
__b__always people have shown improvement with wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere .__c0
__fh__but if we - if we have to use simple spectral subtraction we may have to do some optimization to make it work @@ .__c0
__s__so they're making ==__c2
__s__there - somebody's generating wall street journal with additive - artificially added noise or something ?__c2
__s^e__yeah yeah .__c0
__s^e__sort of a - sort of like what they did with t. i. digits and ==__c2
__fh__yeah .__c0
__b__yeah okay .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c0
__fg__i m- - i guess guenter hirsch is in charge of that .__c0
__s__guenter hirsch and t. i .__c0
__fh__okay .__c2
__s__maybe roger .__c0
__s__r- - roger maybe in charge of .__c0
__s^df__and then they're - they're uh uh generating h. t. k scripts to ?==__c2
__qy^d^f^g__yeah .__c0
__fh__yeah i don't know .__c0
__s^cs__there are - they have - there is no ==__c0
__fh__i don't know if they are converging on h. t. k or are using some mississippi state .__c0
__b__mis- - mississippi state maybe .__c2
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__i'm not sure about that .__c0
__fh__yeah | so that'll be a little - little task in itself .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c0
__fh__um ==__c2
__s__well we've ==__c2
__s^bk__yeah it's true for the additive noise y- - artificially added noise we've always used small vocabulary too .__c2
__s__but for n- - there's been noisy speech this larv- - large vocabulary that we've worked with in broadcast news .__c2
__qw__so we- - we did the broadcast news evaluation .__c2
__%-__and some of the focus conditions were noisy .__c2
__%-__uhhuh .__c0
__qy^bu^rt__and - and ==__c2
__s__it had additive n- ==__c0
__qrr__but we - but we didn't do spectral subtraction .__c2
__s^na__we were doing our funny stuff | right ?__c2
__s^ba__we were doing multi- - multi- - uh multi stream and - and so forth .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c0
__fh__but it you know we di- - stuff we did helped .__c2
__s^na__i mean it did something .__c2
__fh__so ==__c2
__s^bu__okay .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__um ==__c2
__s^cs__now we have this um meeting data .__c2
__s__you know like the stuff we're recording right now .__c2
__s^2^bu__yeah .__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c0
__b__and ==__c2
__fg__and uh ==__c2
__s__that we have uh for the - uh the quote unquote noisy data there is just - noisy and reverberant actually .__c2
__s^cs__it's the far field mike .__c2
__qy^d^f^g__and | uh we have uh the digits that we do at the end of these things .__c2
__s^df__and that's what most o- ==__c2
__b__again most of our work has been done with that .__c2
__qy^d^g.%__with - with uh connected digits .__c2
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c0
__s__um ==__c2
__fh__but uh | we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech .__c2
__s^e__large vocabulary continuous speech using switchboard - uh switchboard recognizer .__c2
__s^e__yeah .__c0
__s^m^na__okay .__c0
__s^aa__uh ==__c2
__b__no training from this .__c2
__s.%--__just - just plain using the switchboard .__c2
__fh__oh you just take the switchboard trained ==__c0
__s__that's - that's what we're doing .__c2
__s^2__yeah .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s^2__yeah .__c0
__s^aa__now there are some adaptation though .__c2
__%-__okay .__c0
__s^aa^r__that - that uh andreas has been playing with .__c2
__b__yeah .__c0
__s.%--__that's cool .__c0
__s__okay .__c0
__%--__but we're hop- ==__c2
__b__uh actually uh dave and i were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future trying some of the techniques that we've talked about on uh some of the large vocabulary data .__c2
__qw__um ==__c2
__s__i mean i guess no one had done - yet done test one on the distant mike using uh the s. r. i recognizer .__c2
__s.%-__and uh ==__c2
__s^e__i don't ==__c5
__fh__not that i know of .__c5
__s^nd__yeah .__c2
__s^bk^m__because everybody's scared .__c2
__s^e__yeah .__c0
__s^aa__you'll see a little smoke coming up from the - the c. p. u or something trying to - trying to do it .__c2
__s__that's right .__c5
__s^bk^m__but ==__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__uh yeah .__c2
__s^aa__but you're right .__c2
__qh^bk__that - that - that's a real good point that uh we - we don't know yeah uh i mean what if any of these ta- ==__c2
__b__i guess that's why they're pushing that in the uh - in the evaluation .__c2
__qw^d__yeah .__c0
__s^rt__uh ==__c2
__s^ar__but um ==__c2
__s^fa__good .__c2
__qw^d__okay .__c2
__s__anything else going on ?__c2
__h__at you guys' end .__c2
__s^no__or ?==__c2
__qy^rt__i don't have good result with the - inc- - including the new parameters .__c1
__qrr.%--__i don't have good result .__c1
__b__are similar or a little bit worse .__c1
__qw__with what - what other new p- - new parameter ?__c0
__s^no__you're talking about your voicing ?__cb
__s^no__yeah .__c2
__s^no__so maybe - you probably need to back up a bit .__c2
__s^no__yeah .__c1
__s^no^r__uhhuh .__c1
__s^no__yeah .__c0
__s^cs__seeing as how sunil ==__c2
__fg__i tried to include another new parameter to the traditional parameter .__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__the coe- - the cepstrum coefficient .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__s^e__that like the auto correlation the r. zero and r. one over r. zero .__c1
__s^2__uhhuh .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__b__and another estimation of the var- - the variance of the difference for - of the spec- - si- - uh spectrum of the signal .__c1
__fg__and - and the spectrum of time after filt- - mel filter bank .__c1
__%--__i'm so sorry .__c0
__fh__i didn't get it .__c0
__fg__nuh well .__c1
__fg__anyway .__c1
__s^cs__the - first you have the sp- - the spectrum of the signal .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__qy^d^f^g^rt__and you have the - on the other side you have the output of the mel filter bank .__c1
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c0
__s^df__you can extend the coefficient of the mel filter bank and obtain an approximation of the spectrum of the signal .__c1
__s^df__huh .__c0
__s^co__okay .__c0
__qy^bu^rt__i do the difference .__c1
__qy.%-__okay .__c0
__s^bk__i found a difference at the variance of this different .__c1
__s^ng__uhhuh .__c0
__fh__because suppose we - we think that if the variance is high maybe you have n- - uh noise .__c1
__s.%--__yeah .__c0
__s__and if the variance is small maybe you have uh speech .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__qy^d^f^g__to - to ==__c1
__b__to ==__c1
__fh__the idea is to found another feature for discriminate between voice sound and unvoice sound .__c1
__s__okay .__c0
__qw__and we try to use this new feature - feature .__c1
__qy^bk^d^m^rt__and i did experiment .__c1
__fh__i need to change - to obtain this new feature i need to change the size - the window size - size .__c1
__s__of the a- - of the - analysis window size .__c1
__s^arp^bu|qy^d^g^rt__to have more information .__c1
__s^arp__yeah .__c0
__b__make it longer .__c0
__s^na__uh | sixty two point five milliseconds i think .__c1
__s^arp__okay .__c0
__b__and ==__c1
__qw^rt__i do - i did two type of experiment to include this feature directly with the - with the other feature .__c1
__s__and to train a neural network to select it voice-unvoice-silence - silence .__c1
__s__unvoiced .__c0
__fg__well .__c0
__qw^d__and to - to concat this new feature .__c1
__s__but the result are ==__c1
__h__n- - with the neural network i have more or less the same result .__c1
__s__as using just the cepstrum ?__c0
__s^r__result .__c1
__fg__or ?==__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__okay .__c0
__s__it's neve- - e- - e- ==__c1
__qy^rt__sometime it's worse .__c1
__qrr.%--__sometime it's a little bit better .__c1
__h|s^no__but not significantly .__c1
__s^aap__and ==__c1
__s^na__uh is it with t. i. digits or with ?==__c0
__qh^bk^rt__no | i work with uh italian and spanish basically .__c1
__s^aa__okay .__c0
__s^aa^r__okay .__c0
__s^e__and if i don't y- - use the neural network and use directly the feature the results are worse .__c1
__s^e__uhhuh .__c0
__s^e__but doesn't help .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__b__i - i - i really wonder though .__c2
__b__i mean we've had these discussions before .__c2
__s.%-__and - and one of the things that struck me was that - uh about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we um - whenever you condense things uh in an irreversible way um you throw away some information .__c2
__b__and that's mostly viewed on as a good thing in the way we use it .__c2
__s^bk__because we want to suppress things that will cause variability for uh particular uh phonetic units .__c2
__s.%--__um ==__c2
__s__but you'll do throw something away .__c2
__s^cs__and so the question is uh can we figure out if there's something we've thrown away that we shouldn't have .__c2
__s__and um ==__c2
__s__so ==__c2
__s__when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the f. f. t that was going into the filter bank i was thinking oh okay .__c2
__b__so they're picking on something .__c2
__fh__they're looking on it to figure out noise or voice - voiced property whatever .__c2
__s.%--__so that - that's interesting .__c2
__fg__maybe that helps to drive the - the thought process of coming up with the features .__c2
__s.%--__but for me sort of the interesting thing was well but is there just something in that difference which is useful .__c2
__s^ar__so another way of doing it maybe would be just to take the f. f. t uh power spectrum and feed it into a neural network .__c2
__s.%--__and then use it you know in combination or alone or - or whatever .__c2
__b__to know ==__c1
__s__wi- - with what targets ?__c5
__s^e__voiced unvoiced is like ==__c0
__fh__uh | no .__c2
__s__oh .__c0
__s^df__or anything .__c0
__fh__no .__c2
__s.%--__the - just the same - same way we're using - i mean the same way that we're using the filter bank .__c2
__b__phones .__c5
__s__oh okay .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^nd__exact way - the same way we're using the filter bank .__c2
__s__i mean the filter bank is good for all the reasons that we say it's good .__c2
__s__but it's different .__c2
__b__and | you know maybe if it's used in combination it will get at something that we're missing .__c2
__fh|s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__and maybe you know using orth- - you know k. l. t or uh um adding probabilities i mean all th- - all the different ways that we've been playing with that we would let the - essentially let the neural network determine what is it that's useful that we're missing here .__c2
__qy^bu^rt__uhhuh .__c3
__qy^bu^rt__yeah | but there is so much variability in the power spectrum .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__s^bk__well that's probably why y- - i- - it would be unlikely to work as well by itself .__c2
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c3
__s^co__but it might help in combination .__c2
__s^co__huh .__c3
__fh__but i - i - i have to tell you ==__c2
__s^co__i can't remember the conference .__c2
__fh__but uh i think it's about ten years ago i remember going to one of the speech conferences .__c2
__s^co__and - and uh ==__c2
__fh|s^co__i saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front end or something .__c2
__b__and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to uh just putting in the f. f. t .__c2
__s__and the f. f. t did slightly better .__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__fh__so i mean the - i- - i- - it's true there's lots of variability .__c2
__fh__but again we have these wonderful statistical mechanisms for quantifying that a- - that variability and you know doing something reasonable with it .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__qw^rt__so ==__c2
__h|s^rt__um ==__c2
__fh|s^cc__uh ==__c2
__s^df__it- - it's same you know argument that's gone both ways about uh you know we have these data driven filters in l. d. a .__c2
__b__and on the other hand if it's data driven it means it's driven by things that have lots of variability and that are necessarily - not necessarily going to be the same in training and test .__c2
__fh__so | in some ways it's good to have data driven things .__c2
__qw^bu^d^rt__and in some ways it's bad to have data driven things .__c2
__h|s__so ==__c2
__s^e__yeah d- ==__c0
__fh|s.%-__part of what we're discovering is ways to combine things that are data driven than are not .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c0
__s^ng__uh so anyway it's just a thought that - that if we - if we had that - maybe it's just a baseline .__c2
__s^ng__uh which would show us well what are we really getting out of the filters .__c2
__s__or maybe i- - i- ==__c2
__s^aa__probably not by itself .__c2
__b__but in combination .__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk^m__uh ==__c2
__s^aa__you know maybe there's something to be gained from it .__c2
__b__and let the ==__c2
__s^bk^m__but you know y- - you've only worked with us for a short time .__c2
__s^aa__maybe in a year or two you w- - you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information .__c2
__s__but maybe the neural net and the h. m. m.'s could figure it out quicker than you .__c2
__b__maybe .__c1
__b__so ==__c2
__fh__it's just a thought .__c2
__b__yeah .__c1
__qy^rt__i can - i will try to do that .__c1
__s^df__yeah .__c2
__fh__what - one - one um p- - one thing is like what - before we started using this v. a. d in this aurora the - th- - what we did was like i - i guess most of you know about this adding this additional speech silence bit to the cepstrum and training the h. m. m on that .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__that is just a binary feature .__c0
__s^no__and that seems to be improving a lot on the speechdat-car where there is a lot of noise .__c0
__h|s__but not much on the t. i. digits .__c0
__s__so a- - adding an additional feature to distin- - to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping .__c0
__s^e__that's it .__c0
__s^df__wait - i - i'm sorry ?__c3
__s^e__yeah we actually added an additional binary feature to the cepstrum .__c0
__s^df__just the baseline .__c0
__b__yeah ?__c3
__s__you did some experiment .__c1
__s__yeah .__c0
__s^df__yeah .__c0
__s^df__well in - in the case of t. i. digits it didn't actually give us anything .__c0
__s^e__because there wasn't any f- - anything to discriminate between speech .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c3
__s__and it was very short .__c0
__b__huh .__c3
__s__but italian was like very - it was a huge improvement on italian .__c0
__fh|s__well ==__c3
__s^m__uhhuh .__c3
__s.%--__but anyway the question is even more is within speech can we get some features .__c3
__fh__are we drop- - dropping information that can might be useful within speech ?__c3
__fg|s^cs__i mean to - maybe to distinguish between voice sound and unvoiced sounds .__c3
__s^cs__okay .__c0
__s^bsc__uhhuh .__c0
__s__yeah yeah .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c0
__s__and it's particularly more relevant now since we're going to be given the endpoints .__c2
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^df__uhhuh .__c3
__s^cs__so ==__c2
__s^br__yeah yeah .__c0
__s__uh ==__c2
__s^df__huh .__c3
__s^df__so ==__c2
__s^bk__um ==__c2
__s^bk__huh .__c0
__s^fa__there was a paper in i. cassp - this i. cassp - over the uh extracting some higher order uh information from the cepstral coefficients .__c0
__s^bk^m__and i forgot the name .__c0
__s^df__some is- - some harmonics ==__c0
__s^fa__i don't know .__c0
__s^fa^r__i can - i can pull that paper out from i. cassp .__c0
__s^bk^m__yeah .__c3
__s^fa__talking cumulants or something ?__c2
__s^bk^m__it ==__c0
__s^bk__huh ?__c0
__s^bk__cumulants or something .__c2
__fg__uh | i don't know .__c0
__fg__but - no .__c2
__%--__i don't remember .__c0
__s^co__it wa- - it was taking the um ==__c0
__s^bs__it was about finding the higher order moments of ==__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c2
__qw^br^d^rt__yeah .__c0
__s__cumulants .__c2
__s__and i'm not sure about whether it is the higher order moments or ==__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__s^e__maybe higher order cumulants .__c0
__s__oh .__c2
__%--__and ==__c0
__fh__yeah .__c0
__s^bs__or m- - e- ==__c2
__%-__it was - it was ==__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c0
__s^aa__i mean he was showing up uh some - something on noisy speech .__c0
__%--__yeah .__c2
__s^aa__some improvement on the noisy speech .__c0
__s^df__uhhuh .__c3
__s^ar__some small vocabulary tasks .__c0
__s^df__uh ==__c2
__b__so it was on p. l. p derived cepstral coefficients .__c0
__fh__yeah | but again - you could argue that th- - that's exactly what the neural network does .__c2
__b__huh .__c0
__s^no__so n- - neural network uh is in some sense equivalent to computing you know higher order moments of what you ==__c2
__s__trying to f- ==__c0
__s__to ==__c0
__s^cc__moments .__c0
__s^e__yeah .__c0
__s^cc__yeah .__c2
__b__yeah .__c0
__s__so ==__c2
__s^bk__i mean it doesn't do it very specifically .__c2
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c3
__s__and ==__c2
__%-__pretty - you know .__c2
__s__but ==__c2
__s^bk__yep .__c0
__s^bu__uh ==__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__anything on your end you want to talk about ?__c2
__s^e__uh ==__c2
__s^bk__um | nothing i want to really talk about .__cb
__s__i can - i can just uh um share a little bit .__cb
__s__sunil hasn't - hasn't heard about uh what i've been doing .__cb
__s__yeah .__c2
__fh__um ==__cb
__s__so ==__cb
__s.%--__um | i told you i was - i was - i was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam .__cb
__s^ba__so basically that's just um trying to propose um uh your next your - your following years of - of your p. h. d work .__cb
__s^cs__trying - trying to find a project to - to define and - and to work on .__cb
__b__so i've been uh looking into um doing something about r- - uh speech recognition using acoustic events .__cb
__s^cs__so ==__cb
__s^cs__um the idea is you have all these - these different events .__cb
__b__for example voicing .__cb
__fg__nasality .__cb
__s__r. coloring .__cb
__fh|s.%--__you know burst .__cb
__s__or noise uh frication .__cb
__s^e__that kind of stuff .__cb
__b__um building robust um primary detectors for these acoustic events .__cb
__s^e__and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition .__cb
__s^e__um ==__cb
__s^bk__and um | these - these primary detectors um will be uh inspired by you know multi band techniques um doing things um similar to larry saul's work on uh graphical models to - to detect these - these uh acoustic events .__cb
__s^bk__and um | so i - i been - i been thinking about that .__cb
__fg|s__and some of the issues that i've been running into are um exactly what - what kind of acoustic events i need .__cb
__qy^d^g__what - um what acoustic events will provide a - a good enough coverage to - in order to do the later recognition steps .__cb
__s__and also um once i decide a set of acoustic events um h- - how do i - how do i get labels .__cb
__b__training data for - for these acoustic events .__cb
__b__and then later on down the line i can start playing with the - the models themselves .__cb
__qy^d^f^g^rt__the - the primary detectors .__cb
__s__um ==__cb
__b__so ==__cb
__s__um | i kind of see - like after - after building the primary detectors i see um myself taking the outputs and feeding them in sort of tandem style into - into a um gaussian mixtures h. m. m back end um and doing recognition .__cb
__s^aa__um ==__cb
__s^aa^r__so | that's - that's just generally what i've been looking at .__cb
__fh|s__yeah .__c0
__b__um ==__cb
__b__by - by the way uh the voiced-unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what carmen was looking at .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__cb
__s^co__so ==__c2
__s^e__uhhuh .__c3
__b__you know um if you - if a multi band approach was helpful as - as i think it is .__c2
__%--__it seems to be helpful for determining voiced-unvoiced .__c2
__fh__uhhuh .__cb
__s__that one might be another thing .__c2
__s^e__yeah .__cb
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s^df__yeah .__cb
__fh__um ==__cb
__s^bd__were - were you going to say something ?__cb
__fh__huh .__c5
__b__oh .__cb
__fh__it looked ==__cb
__b__okay .__cb
__s^rt^tc__never mind .__cb
__s__um yeah .__cb
__s__and so this - this past week um i've been uh looking a little bit into uh traps um and doing - doing traps on - on these e- - events too .__cb
__s__just um seeing - seeing if that's possible .__cb
__s^2__uh ==__cb
__s^aa__and ==__cb
__fg__um | other than that uh i was kicked out of i. house for living there for four years .__cb
__s.%--__oh no .__c2
__s.%--__so you live in a cardboard box in the street now ?__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__cb
__s^ft__or no ?__c2
__s__uh | well s- - s- - som- - something like that .__cb
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s__in albany .__cb
__b__yeah .__cb
__s__yeah .__cb
__s__and uh ==__cb
__s__yep .__cb
__b__that's it .__cb
__s^cs__suni- - i- - did you v- - did uh - did you find a place ?__c2
__b__is that out of the way ?__c2
__fh__uh | no .__c0
__s__not yet .__c0
__s^e__uh yesterday i called up a lady who ha- - who will have a vacant room from may thirtieth .__c0
__s__and she said she's interviewing two more people .__c0
__fh__so ==__c0
__s__and she would get back to me on monday .__c0
__b__so that's - that's only thing i have .__c0
__s__and diane has a few more houses .__c0
__s^df__she's going to take some pictures and send me after i go back .__c0
__b__okay .__c2
__s__so it's - that's ==__c0
__fh|s.%--__oh .__c5
__s__so you're not down here permanently yet ?__c5
__fh__no .__c0
__%--__i'm going back to o. g. i today .__c0
__fh__uh .__c5
__s__oh okay .__c5
__s^e__oh .__cb
__s.%--__okay .__c2
__s__and then you're coming back uh ?==__c2
__s__uh i- - i mean i - i p- - i plan to be here on thirty first .__c0
__fh__thirty first .__c2
__fh__okay .__c2
__s__thirty first .__cb
__fh__yeah .__c0
__qy.%--__well if there's a house available or place to .__c0
__s^no.%--__well i mean i- - i- - if - if ==__c2
__qw__yeah i hope .__c0
__s__they're available .__c2
__s__and they'll be able to get you something .__c2
__s^aa__so worst comes to worst we'll put you up in a hotel for - for - for a while .__c2
__%--__yeah .__c0
__fh__so in that case i'm going to be here on thirty first definitely .__c0
__fh__until you ==__c2
__%--__okay .__c2
__s^na__you know if you're in a desperate situation and you need a place to stay you could stay with me for a while .__c4
__%--__i've got a spare bedroom right now .__c4
__qy__oh okay .__c0
__s^no__thanks .__c0
__s^ar__that sure is nice of you .__c0
__s^bk__so it may be he needs more than me .__c0
__fg__oh r- ==__cb
__qy__oh .__cb
__s^df__oh no no .__cb
__s^aa__my - my cardboard box is actually a nice spacious two bedroom apartment .__cb
__s^aa__so a two bedroom cardboard box .__c2
__s^na__th- - that's great .__c2
__b__yeah .__cb
__s^j__yeah yeah yeah .__c0
__fh__thanks dave .__c2
__b__yeah .__c0
__fh__um ==__c2
__s^df__yeah .__c0
__fh__do y- - want to say anything about ?==__c2
__fh__you - you actually been ==__c2
__s^bk__uh | last week you were doing this stuff with pierre you were - you were mentioning .__c2
__s__is that - that something worth talking about ?__c2
__s__or ?==__c2
__b__um ==__c4
__s^bk|s^no.%--__it's ==__c4
__qy.%--__well um it - i don't think it directly relates .__c4
__s^bs__um | well so i was helping a speech researcher named pierre divenyi .__c4
__qw^bu^rt__and he's int- - he wanted to um look at um how people respond to formant changes i think .__c4
__s^rt__um ==__c4
__s^bk^m__so he - he created a lot of synthetic audio files of vowel to vowel transitions .__c4
__s^bk__and then he wanted a psycho acoustic um spectrum .__c4
__s^bk__and he wanted to look at um how the energy is moving over time in that spectrum .__c4
__b__and compare that to the - to the listener tests .__c4
__s^j__and um ==__c4
__fh__so i gave him a p. l. p spectrum .__c4
__s^bk__and - to um - he - he t- - wanted to track the peaks so he could look at how they're moving .__c4
__s^cc__so i took the um p. l. p l. p. c coefficients and um i found the roots .__c4
__b__this was something that stephane suggested .__c4
__s^bk|s__i found the roots of the um l. p. c polynomial to um track the peaks in the um p. l. p l. p. c spectra .__c4
__s__well there is aligned spectral pairs is like the - the ==__c0
__s^e.%--__is that the aligned s- ?==__c0
__s__it's a r- - root l. p. c uh of some sort .__c2
__fh|s.%--__oh no .__c0
__s^df__uhhuh .__c3
__s^e.%--__so you just ==__c0
__s^cs__yeah .__c2
__s__instead of the log you took the root square - i mean cubic root or something .__c0
__b__what di- - w- - i didn't get that .__c0
__s.%--__no no .__c2
__qy^bu.%--__it's - it's - it's taking the - finding the roots of the l. p. c polynomial .__c2
__s^ng__polynomial .__c0
__s^bu.%--__yeah .__c0
__s.%--__is that the line spectral ?==__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__so it's like line spectral pairs .__c2
__s^aa__oh it's like line sp- ==__c0
__s__except i think what they call line spectral pairs they push it towards the unit circle .__c2
__s^e__don't they ?__c2
__s^e__to sort of ==__c2
__fh__yeah yeah yeah yeah .__c0
__s^e__but it ==__c2
__s^e__but uh you know .__c2
__s^e__but what we'd used to do w- - when i did synthesis at national semiconductor twenty years ago the technique we were playing with initially was - was taking the l. p. c polynomial and - and uh finding the roots .__c2
__s__it wasn't p. l. p because hynek hadn't invented it yet .__c2
__s__but it was just l. p. c .__c2
__s__and uh we found the roots of the polynomial .__c2
__s__and th- - when you do that sometimes they're f- - they're what most people call formants .__c2
__s__sometimes they're not .__c2
__s__huh .__c0
__s^df__so it's - it's - it's a little ==__c2
__s^df__huh .__c3
__s^df__uh - formant tracking with it can be a little tricky .__c2
__s^df__because you get these funny values in - in real speech .__c2
__s^bk__so you just - you typically just get a few roots ?__c5
__s^cs__but ==__c2
__b__you know ?__c5
__fh__two or three .__c5
__s^bk__something like that .__c5
__s.%--__well you get these complex pairs .__c2
__%--__and it depends on the order that you're doing .__c2
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c3
__%--__right .__c4
__s^cs__but ==__c2
__s^aa__so um ==__c4
__s__if - @@ every root that's ==__c4
__s^df__since it's a real signal the l. p. c polynomial's going to have real coefficients .__c4
__fh__so i think that means that every root that is not a real root is going to be a c- - complex pair .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__b__um of a complex value and its conjugate .__c4
__b__um ==__c4
__fg|s.%--__so for each ==__c4
__qy^rt__and if you look at that on the unit circle um one of these - one of the members of the pair will be a positive frequency one will be a negative frequency i think .__c4
__s^aa__so i just ==__c4
__s__so um ==__c4
__s__f- - for the - i'm using an eighth order polynomial .__c4
__s^e__and i'll get three or four of these pairs .__c4
__fh__yeah .__c2
__fh|s__which give me s- - which gives me three or four peak positions .__c4
__s__huh .__c0
__s__this is from synthetic speech ?__c2
__fh__or ?==__c2
__s^cs__it's - right .__c4
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s^df__yeah .__c2
__s^df__so if it's from synthetic speech then maybe it'll be cleaner .__c2
__s__i mean for real speech in real - then what you end up having is like i say funny little things that are - don't exactly fit your notion of formants all that well .__c2
__s^cs__how did ?==__c5
__fh__but- ==__c3
__fh__but - but mostly they are .__c2
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__mostly they do .__c2
__fh__huh .__c4
__s__and - and what - i mean in - in what we were doing which was not so much looking at things it was okay .__c2
__s^e__i ==__c3
__s^cs__because it was just a question of quantization .__c2
__s^aa__uh | we were just you know storing ==__c2
__fg__it was - we were doing uh stored speech uh quantization .__c2
__fg__uhhuh .__c3
__s.%--__but - but uh in your case ==__c2
__qw__um you know ==__c2
__h__actually you have peaks that are not at the formant's positions .__c3
__s__but they are lower in energy .__c3
__fh__but - there's some of that .__c4
__qw^bu^d__yes .__c4
__fh__and - well they are much lower .__c3
__%--__if this is synthetic speech can't you just get the formants directly ?__c5
__fh__i mean h- - how is the speech created ?__c5
__s__it was created from a synthesizer .__c4
__s^rt__and um ==__c4
__s__wasn't a formant synthesizer | was it ?__c5
__%-__i bet it - it might have - may have been .__c2
__s^bk__i - d- - d- - this ==__c4
__s^ba^na__but maybe he didn't have control over it or something ?__c2
__%-__in - in fact w- - we - we could get um formant frequencies out of the synthesizer as well .__c4
__s^df__and um ==__c4
__s.%--__w- - one thing that the um l. p. c approach will hopefully give me in addition um is that i - i might be able to find the b- - the bandwidths of these humps as well .__c4
__b__um stephane suggested looking at each complex pair as a - like a se- - second order i. i. r filter .__c4
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^df__um ==__c4
__s^cs__but i don't think there's a g- - a really good reason not to um get the formant frequencies from the synthesizer instead .__c4
__b__except that you don't have the psycho acoustic modeling in that .__c4
__fh__yeah .__c2
__s__so the actual ==__c2
__s^ba__so you're not getting the actual formants per se .__c2
__fg__you're getting the - again you're getting sort of the ==__c2
__%--__uh ==__c2
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c3
__s__you're getting something that is - is uh af- - strongly affected by the p. l. p model .__c2
__s__and so it's more psycho acoustic .__c2
__fh__so it's a little - it's - it's - it's sort of - sort of a different thing .__c2
__s^cs__oh .__c5
__s^bk__i see .__c5
__qy^bu^d^rt__that's sort of the point .__c5
__fh__but - yeah .__c2
__s^df__i- - ordinarily in a formant synthesizer the bandwidths as well as the ban- - uh formant centers are ==__c2
__s^aa__yeah .__c5
__s^bk__i mean that's - somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in .__c2
__s^cs__as - as what you ==__c2
__fh|s^co__uhhuh .__c4
__fh__but - but yeah .__c2
__qo.%--__you view each complex pair as essentially a second order section .__c2
__s__which has uh band center and band width .__c2
__s__and um ==__c2
__qo^d^rt__um ==__c2
__s^df__but ==__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__fh__okay .__c2
__b__so uh ==__c2
__b__yeah you're going back today .__c2
__fg__and then back in a week i guess .__c2
__fg__and ==__c2
__s^t^tc__yeah .__c0
__s^df__yeah .__c2
__s^e__great .__c2
__qw__well welcome .__c2
__h__thanks .__c0
__h__i guess we should do digits quickly ?__c5
__s__huh .__c3
__s^df__oh yeah digits .__c2
__b__i almost forgot that .__c2
__s^cs__digits .__c1
