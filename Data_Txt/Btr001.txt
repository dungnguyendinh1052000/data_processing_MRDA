__z__as usual .__c4
__z__yes .__c1
__z__whew !__c1
__z__i almost forgot about the meeting .__c1
__z__i woke up twenty minutes ago thinking what did i forget .__c1
__z__it's great how the br- - brain sort of does that .__c3
__z__something's not right here .__c4
__z__internal alarms .__c1
__z__okay .__c3
__z__so the news for me is a.  my forthcoming travel plans .__c3
__z__in two weeks from today .__c3
__z__yes .__c1
__z__yeah ?__c3
__z__more or less .__c3
__z__i'll be off to sicily and germany for a couple three days .__c3
__z__now what are y- - what are you doing there ?__c1
__z__i forgot .__c1
__z__okay | i'm flying to sicily basically to drop off simon there with his grandparents .__c3
__z__and then i'm flying to germany t- - to go to a moku-treffen .__c3
__z__which is the meeting of all the module responsible people in smartkom .__c3
__fg__huh .__c1
__s^ft__and represent i. c. i .__c3
__fg__and myself i guess there .__c3
__fh__and um ==__c3
__s__that's the huh actual reason .__c3
__fh|s^t^tc__and then i'm also going up to e. m. l for a day .__c3
__s^e__and then i'm going to meet the very big boss wolfgang walster in saarbruecken and the system system integration people in kaiserslautern .__c3
__fh|s__and then i'm flying back via sicily .__c3
__s__pick up my son .__c3
__fh__come back here on the fourth of july .__c3
__b__and uh ==__c3
__s__what a great time to be coming back to the u. s. of a. .__c4
__s^df__god bless america .__c1
__s^df__you'll see maybe - see the fireworks from your plane coming in .__c4
__s__and i'm sure all the - the people at the airport will be happy to work on that day .__c3
__fg__yeah .__c4
__fh__you'll get even better service than usual .__c4
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c3
__s^cs__wait aren't you flying on lufthansa though ?__c1
__s^cs__alitalia .__c3
__s^cs__oh | well then the - you know it's not a big deal .__c1
__fg__once you get to the united states it'll be a problem .__c1
__fh__but ==__c1
__s^cs.%--__yeah .__c3
__qw__and um ==__c3
__s^bk__that's that bit of news .__c3
__b__and the other bit of news is we had - you know uh i was visited by my german project manager .__c3
__s__who a.  did like what we did .__c3
__fh|s^df^rt__what we're doing here .__c3
__b__and b.  is planning to come here either three weeks in july or three weeks in august to actually work .__c3
__s^df.%--__on ?==__c1
__fh__with us .__c3
__s^no__oh .__c1
__s^e__and we sat around and we talked .__c3
__s^df__and he came up - we came up - with a pretty strange idea .__c3
__s__and that's what i'm going to lay on you now .__c3
__s.%--__and um | maybe it might be ultimately the most interesting thing for eva .__c3
__s__because she has been known to complain about the fact that the stuff we do here is not weird enough .__c3
__fh__okay .__c2
__s^bu__so this is so weird it should even make you happy .__c3
__s^aa__uh okay .__c2
__s^aa^r__oh great .__c4
__s^aa__imagine if you will that we have a system that does all that understanding that we want it to do based on utterances .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__b__it should be possible to make that system produce questions .__c3
__s:s__so if you have the knowledge of how to interpret where is x.  under given conditions situational user discourse and ontological conditions you should also be able to make that same system ask where is x.  .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__in a sper- - certain way .__c3
__s__based on certain intentions .__c3
__%-__so in- - instead of just being able to observe phenomenon um and guess the intention we might be able just to sort of give it an intention and make it produce an utterance .__c3
__s^aa__huh .__c4
__s^e__well like in a. i they generally do the take in .__c1
__b__and then they also do the generation phase like nancy's thing .__c1
__s^bk__or uh ==__c1
__s^ba__you remember in the - the hand thing in one eighty two like not only was it able to recognize but it was also to generate based upon situations .__c1
__s|qy^d^g__you mean that sort of thing ?__c1
__s^df__absolutely .__c3
__s^aa__okay .__c1
__fh__and once you've done that what we can do is have the system ask itself .__c3
__s^na__and answer .__c3
__b__understand the answer .__c3
__fh__ask something else .__c3
__b__and enter a dialogue with itself .__c3
__s__so the - the ba- - basic - the same idea as having two chess computers play against each other .__c3
__s^df^rt__except this smacks a little bit more of a schizophrenic computer than a. i .__c4
__s^df^rt__yeah | you c- - if you want you can have two parallel machines um asking each other .__c3
__s__what would that give us ?__c3
__b__would a.  be something completely weird and strange .__c3
__b__and b.  i- - if you look at all the factors we will never observe people let's say in wheelchairs under - you know in - under all conditions .__c3
__b__that's good .__c4
__s^aa__you know when they say x.  and there is a ride at the goal and the parking is good we can never collect enough data .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s^df__it's - it's - it's not possible .__c3
__s^df__right right .__c4
__b__but maybe one could do some learning .__c3
__s__if you get the system to speak to itself you may find n- - break downs and errors and you may be able to learn .__c3
__s^df__and make it more robust .__c3
__s^ba__maybe learn new things .__c3
__s__and um ==__c3
__s__so there's no - no end of potential things one could get out of it if that works .__c3
__b__and he would like to actually work on that with us .__c3
__b__so ==__c3
__b__well then he probably should be coming back a year from now .__c1
__s^ba__yeah | i w- ==__c3
__b__see the - the generation bit making the system generate - generate something is - shouldn't be too hard .__c3
__fh__well once the system understands things .__c1
__s__yeah | no problem .__c4
__s^e__i just don't think i think we're probably a year away from getting the system to understand things .__c1
__s^bk__yeah | well if we can get it to understand one thing like our where is run through we can also maybe e- - make it say or ask where is x.  or not @@ .__c3
__b__huh i don't know .__c4
__s.%--__e- - i'm sort of - have the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so on .__c4
__s.%-__you know i mean just because it's sort of harder to learn to speak correctly in a foreign language rather than learning to understand it | right ?__c4
__s^e__i mean ==__c4
__s^df__@@ ==__c3
__fh__just the fact that we'll get - the point is that getting it to understand one construction doesn't mean that it will n- - always know exactly when it's correct to use that construction | right ?__c4
__b__it's - it's uh ==__c3
__b__well i've - i've done generation and language production research for fo- - four - four and a half years .__c3
__s__and so it's - it's - you're right .__c3
__s__it's not the same as the understanding .__c3
__%--__it's in some ways easier and some ways harder | nuh ?__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__but um ==__c3
__s__i think it'd be fun to look at it or into that question .__c3
__s^df__nnn yeah .__c4
__s__it's a pretty strange idea .__c3
__s__and so that's - that's - but ==__c3
__s__the basic idea i guess would be to give - allow the system to have intentions basically .__c1
__s^bk__because that's basically what needs to be added to the system for it .__c1
__s^bk__well look at th- ==__c3
__qy.%--__eee i think even - think even ==__c3
__s^ar__what it - would be the - the prior intention .__c3
__s^j__so let's uh - uh let's say we have this ==__c3
__s^aa__well we'd have to seed that .__c1
__s__i mean ==__c1
__s^e__no let's - we have to - we have some - some top down processing given certain setting .__c3
__s__okay now we change nothing and just say ask something .__c3
__b__right ?__c3
__s__@@ ==__c1
__s^bk__what would it ask ?__c3
__s^df__it wouldn't know what to ask .__c1
__b__i mean ==__c1
__s__it shur- ==__c3
__%__unless it was in a situation .__c1
__qw.%--__we'd have to set up a situation where it didn't know where something was and it wanted to go there .__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^df__uhhuh .__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__which means that we'd need to set up an intention inside of the system | right ?__c1
__s^no__uh n- ==__c3
__s.%--__which is basically i don't know where something is and i need to go there .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__ooh do we really need to do that ?__c3
__s^aa__because ==__c3
__qy^d^g^rt__well no | i guess not .__c1
__b__excel- ==__c1
__s__s- ==__c3
__s^aa__it's - i- - i know it's - it's strange .__c3
__s^bk__but look at it look at our bayes-net .__c3
__s__if we don't have let's assume we don't have any input from the language | right ?__c3
__s^bk__so there's also nothing we could query the ontology .__c3
__s^bk__but we have a certain user setting .__c3
__b__if you just ask what is the likelihood of that person wanting to enter some - something it'll give you an answer .__c3
__s^no__right ?__c3
__%__that's just how they are .__c3
__fh__sure .__c1
__s__and so @@ whatever that is it's the generic default intention that it would find out .__c3
__s__which is wanting to know where something is .__c3
__b__maybe nnn - and wanting ==__c3
__s__i don't know what it's going to be .__c3
__s^bk__but there's going to be something that ==__c3
__s^bk__well you're not going to - are you going to get a variety of intentions out of that then ?__c4
__s^bk__i mean you're just talking about like given this user what's the th- - what is it - what is that user most likely to want to do .__c4
__%__and have it talk about ==__c4
__s__well you can observe some user and context stuff and ask what's the posterior probabilities of all of our decision nodes .__c3
__s^bd__okay .__c4
__x__you could even say let's take all the priors .__c3
__fg__let's observe nothing and query all the posterior probabilities .__c3
__qw^tc__it- - it's going to tell us something .__c3
__qy.%-__right ?__c3
__s__and ==__c3
__b__well it will d- - r- - assign values to all the nodes | yes .__c1
__b__yes | and come up with posterior probabilities for all the values of the decision nodes .__c3
__s^e__which if we have an algorithm that filters out whatever the - the best or the most consistent answer out of that will give us the intention ex nihilo .__c3
__fh__and that is exactly what would happen if we ask it to produce an utterance .__c3
__fh__it would be b- - based on that extension ex nihilo .__c3
__s__which we don't know what it is .__c3
__s__but it's there .__c3
__s:s^fe__so we wouldn't even have to - t- - to kick start it by giving it a certain intention or observing anything on the decision node .__c3
__s.%--__and whatever that maybe that would lead to what is the castle .__c3
__b__i'm just ==__c1
__qy^d^f^g__or what is that whatever .__c3
__fh__i guess what i'm afraid of is if we don't you know set up a situation we'll just get a bunch of garbage out .__c1
__s__like you know everything's exactly thirty percent .__c1
__s^df__no .__c3
__s__huh .__c2
__s__yeah | so what we actually then need to do is - is write a little script that changes all the settings .__c3
__s.%--__you know go- - goes through all the permutations .__c3
__qy^d^f^g__which is - we did a ==__c3
__s^df__didn't we calculate that once ?__c3
__s__well that was - that was absurdly low in the last meeting .__c1
__b__it's a ==__c3
__fh|s__uh ==__c2
__s^e__because i went and looked at it .__c1
__s^df^rt__because i was thinking that could not be right .__c1
__b__and it would - it was on the order of twenty output nodes and something like twenty ==__c1
__b__and like thirty input nodes .__c2
__s^e__thirty input nodes .__c1
__s^e__or some ==__c2
__s__so to test every output node uh would at least ==__c1
__fh__let's see so it would be two to the thirty for every output node .__c1
__fh__which is very th- - very large .__c1
__s^e__oh | that's n- ==__c3
__qw.%--__oh .__c4
__s__that's - that's nothing for those neural guys .__c3
__b__i mean they train for millions and millions of epochs .__c3
__qw^rt__so ==__c3
__qy^bu^d__well i'm talking about ==__c1
__qrr.%--__oh i was going to take a drink of my water .__c1
__h|s^aa__i'm talking about billions and billions and billions and ==__c1
__s__a number ==__c1
__s^bk__two to the thirty is like a- ==__c1
__fh__bhaskara said we had calculated out and bhaskara believes that it's larger than the number of particles in the universe .__c1
__s__and if i- ==__c1
__fh__i don't know if that's right or not .__c4
__b__th- - that's big .__c4
__fh|s__that's just - that's uh - it's a billion | right ?__c4
__s^e__two to the thirty ?__c1
__s__well two to the thirty is a billion .__c1
__b__but if we have to do it two to the twenty times then that's a very very large number .__c1
__s^bu__right .__c4
__s^ar__argh .__c4
__s^df__oh okay .__c4
__s^bk|s^ba__yeah yeah | that's big .__c4
__s^ba^r__because you have to query the node for every a- - uh or query the net two to the twenty times .__c1
__%--__sure .__c4
__s^df__all right .__c4
__b__or not two to th- ==__c1
__s__excuse me | twenty times .__c1
__b__okay | so is it t- - comes to twenty billion or something ?__c4
__s^ba__yes .__c1
__b__that's pretty big though .__c4
__b__as far as ==__c1
__s__that's @@ - that's big .__c1
__b__actually ==__c1
__s^df__oh | we calculated a different number before .__c1
__b__how did we do that ?__c1
__b__huh .__c2
__b__i remember there being some other one floating around .__c4
__s__but anyway uh ==__c4
__s__i don't really know .__c2
__s^aa__yeah | it's g- - anyway the point is that given all of these different factors it's uh e- - it's - it's still going to be impossible to run through all of the possible situations or whatever .__c4
__s^df__ooo it's just big .__c2
__s^bk__but i mean this'll get us a bit closer at least | right ?__c4
__s^df__i mean ==__c4
__fh__if it takes us a second to do for each one and let's say it's twenty billion then that's twenty billion seconds .__c1
__%--__which is ==__c1
__s.%--__yeah .__c4
__s:s__eva do the math .__c1
__s__long .__c4
__b__can't .__c2
__fh|s.%--__@@ ==__c2
__s__hours and hours and hours and hours .__c1
__s^df__but we can do randomized testing .__c1
__s^df^rt__tah-dah !__c4
__s^bk__which probabilistically will be good enough .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^rt__yeah | so it be it- - it's an idea that one could n- - for - for example run - run past um ==__c3
__qy.%--__what's that guy's name ?__c3
__fh__you know he- - he's usually here .__c3
__s__tsk .__c3
__qy__here in the group ?__c4
__%--__j- - j- - jer- - jer - j- ==__c3
__s^bk__jerry feldman ?__c4
__s^bu|qy^d^g^rt__oh yeah | that's the guy .__c3
__qy.%-__we - we - we - we g- ==__c3
__s__wait | who ?__c1
__fh__yeah i- - that would the g- - the bald guy .__c4
__s^no__oh | my advisor .__c1
__s^bk__and um ==__c3
__s__so this is just an idea that's floating around .__c3
__s^e__and we'll see what happens .__c3
__s^bk__and um huh ==__c3
__fh__what other news do i have ?__c3
__s^aa__well we fixed some more things from the smartkom system .__c3
__s^bk__but that's not really of general interest .__c3
__fh__um ==__c3
__s.%--__oh | questions .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__fh__i'll ask eva about the e. bayes and she's working on that .__c3
__s^rt__how is the generation x. m. l thing ?__c3
__s^df__i'm going to work on that today and tomorrow .__c1
__s^e__okay | no need to do it today or tomorrow even .__c3
__s__do it next week or ==__c3
__s__i'm going to finish it today uh hopefully .__c1
__s^df.%-__okay .__c3
__s^ba__i want to do one of those things where i stay here .__c1
__s^ba__because uh if i go home i can't finish it .__c1
__b__i've tried about five times so far where i work for a while and then i'm like i'm hungry .__c1
__s__so i go home and then i think ==__c1
__s.%--__i'm not going back .__c4
__b__yeah .__c1
__b__either that or i think to myself i can work at home .__c1
__s^aa__and then i try to work at home but i fail miserably .__c1
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s^bk|s^ba__like i ended up at blakes last night .__c1
__s__non conducive .__c4
__b__no .__c1
__b__i almost got into a brawl .__c1
__s^df__but i did not finish the uh smartkom .__c1
__b__but i've been looking into it .__c1
__b__i th- - @@ it's not like it's a blank slate .__c1
__fh__i found everything that i need .__c1
__b__and stu- - and uh ==__c1
__s__but st- ==__c3
__s^no__at the b- ==__c1
__s^na__uh furthermore i told jerry that i was going to finish it before he got back .__c1
__s^df.%--__so ==__c1
__s^bk__okay .__c3
__s__that's approaching .__c4
__s__he's coming back when ?__c4
__b__uh next ==__c4
__b__well i think - we think we'll see him definitely on tuesday for the next ==__c1
__b__or no wait .__c1
__b__the meetings are on thursday .__c1
__s^aa|s^na__maybe .__c3
__s^aa__who knows ?__c3
__s^ba__maybe .__c1
__s__okay .__c4
__s^df__well we'll see him next week .__c1
__s^aa__all right .__c4
__%-__that's good .__c3
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__the paper .__c3
__s__huh .__c4
__s|s^bk__huh .__c3
__s^bk__i was thinking about that .__c1
__b__i think ==__c1
__s^bk|s__i will try to work on the smartkom stuff .__c1
__%-__and i'll - if i can finish it today i'll help you with that tomorrow .__c1
__s__if you work on it .__c1
__%__i don't have a problem with us working on it though .__c1
__%__so ==__c1
__s^fe__okay .__c3
__s__so you would say it's funky .__c3
__%__and it ==__c1
__s__cool .__c3
__s__i mean we just - i mean it wouldn't hurt to write up a paper .__c1
__s^e.%--__because then i mean yeah - i was talking with nancy .__c1
__s.%--__and nancy said you don't know whether you have a paper to write up until you write it up .__c1
__fh__so ==__c1
__b__yeah .__c4
__b__well ==__c3
__s^bk__and since jerry's coming back we can run it by him too .__c1
__b__so ==__c1
__s__yep .__c3
__%__um what's your input ?__c3
__s__well um | i don't have much experience with uh conference papers for compu- - in the computer science realm .__c4
__b__and so when i looked at what you had which was apparently a complete submission i just sort of said ==__c4
__s^ba__what - just ==__c4
__s__i - i didn't really know what to do with it .__c4
__%-__like this is the sort of the basic outline of the system or whatever .__c4
__s:qw^rt__or ==__c4
__%__or ==__c4
__s__here's an idea | right .__c4
__s^bk__that's what that paper was .__c4
__s__here's - here's one possible thing you could do .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s^e__short .__c4
__s^bk__eight pages .__c4
__s^ba__and i just don't know what you have in mind for expanding .__c4
__b__like i'd - i - what i didn't do is go to the web site of the conference .__c4
__s^bk__and look at what they're looking for or whatever .__c4
__fg|s.%--__uhhuh .__c3
__s^rt__well it seems to me that um ==__c3
__s__wait | is this a computer science conference ?__c1
__fh__or is it a ?==__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__um well | it's more .__c3
__s__it's both | right ?__c3
__s^na__it's - it's sort of t- - cognitive neural psycho linguistic .__c3
__s__but all for the sake of doing computer science .__c3
__s__so it's sort of cognitive psycho neural plausibly motivated architectures of natural language processing .__c3
__s^na__so it seems pretty interdisciplinary .__c3
__s^df__and i mean w- - w- - the keynote speaker is tomasello .__c3
__b__right oh yeah .__c4
__fh__and blah blah blah .__c3
__s^bk|s__so ==__c3
__b__w- - the - the question is what could we actually do and - and - and keep a straight face while doing it .__c3
__s.%--__and i- ==__c3
__s.%--__well i really can't keep a straight face doing anything .__c1
__s:qw__my idea is ==__c3
__s__setting that aside .__c4
__s^2__well you can say we have done a little bit .__c3
__s^df__and that's this .__c3
__b__and uh sort of the rest is position paper .__c3
__b__we want to also do that .__c3
__b__which is not too good .__c3
__b__might be more interesting to do something like let's assume um we're right .__c3
__b__we have as jerry calls it a delusion of adequacy .__c3
__b__and take a where is x.  sentence .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__b__and say we will just talk about this .__c3
__b__and how we cognitively neurally psycho-linguistically construction grammar ally motivated envision uh understanding that .__c3
__s^rt__huh .__c4
__qy.%--__so we can actually show how we parse it .__c3
__s.%--__that should be able to - we should be able to come up with you know a sort of a - a parse .__c3
__s^df__right .__c4
__b__it's on .__c3
__s.%--__just - just put it on .__c3
__fh__okay .__c0
__s__did ben harass you ?__c1
__s__hi .__c0
__s^no__yes .__c0
__qy^bu__good .__c1
__s^no__was he supposed to harass me ?__c0
__b__yes .__c1
__s^e__well he just told me that you came looking for me .__c0
__s^df__you don- ==__c3
__s^e__@@ ==__c3
__b__oh .__c1
__b__you will suffer in hell .__c3
__s__@@ figure this out .__c0
__b__you know that .__c3
__s__backwards .__c4
__s^bu__there's a s- - diagram somewhere which tells you how to put that ==__c4
__b__i know .__c0
__qy^d^g^rt__i didn't understand that either .__c0
__s^df.%--__this is it .__c3
__s^aa__no wait you have to put it on exactly like that .__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^df__so put that - those things over your ears like that .__c1
__s^na__okay .__c0
__s__see the p- - how the plastic things ar- - arch out like that ?__c1
__b__there we go .__c1
__b__okay .__c0
__fh__it hurts .__c0
__s__it hurts | it hurts real bad .__c1
__s__it does .__c0
__b__but that's what you get for coming late to the meeting .__c4
__b__i'm sorry | i didn't mean to ==__c0
__s__i'm sorry .__c0
__b__i'm sorry | oh these are all the same .__c0
__s.%--__okay | th- - this is not very on target .__c0
__fh__is your mike on ?__c1
__qw__an- ==__c2
__qy^d^rt__yeah | it is .__c3
__s^m^na__shoot .__c0
__s^aa__okay .__c1
__fh__all right you guys can continue talking about whatever you were talking about before .__c0
__%--__um ==__c4
__fh__we're talking about this um alleged paper that we may just sort of w- ==__c3
__qy__oh | which johno mentioned to me .__c0
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c0
__b__and i just sort of brought forth the idea that we take a sentence where is the powder tower .__c3
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c0
__s^rt__and we - we p- - pretend to parse it .__c3
__%__we pretend to understand it .__c3
__fh|s__and we write about it .__c3
__b__huh .__c4
__b__about how all of these things ==__c4
__s^na__what's the part that's not pretend ?__c0
__s__the writing ?__c0
__b__okay | then we pretend to write about .__c3
__b__the submitting to a major international conference | yeah .__c4
__fg|s__tha- - which conference is it for ?__c0
__b__it's the whatever architectures uh you know where ==__c3
__fh__there is this conference it's the seventh already international conference on neu- - neurally cognitively motivated architectures of natural language processing .__c3
__s__oh | wow interesting .__c0
__%--__and | the keynote speakers are tomasello macwhinney .__c3
__s^df__we- - macwhinney i think .__c3
__s__whinney macwhinney | uhhuh .__c0
__b__macwhinney .__c4
__s__so interesting both like child language people .__c0
__s^na__yeah .__c3
__s:s__yep .__c3
__b__okay .__c0
__s^aa__so maybe you want to write something too .__c3
__b__yeah | maybe i want to go .__c0
__s__huh huh .__c4
__s^bk__um why are they speaking at it if it ?==__c0
__s__is - is it normally like - like dialogue systems or you know other n. l. p. ish things ?__c0
__fh__no no no no no no no no | it's - it's like a ==__c3
__b__oh | it's cognitive .__c0
__s^ba__okay .__c0
__s^aa__yeah yeah .__c3
__fh__even neuro .__c3
__s^df__and ==__c0
__b__uh both learning and like comprehension production that kind of stuff .__c0
__s__psycho .__c3
__s__@@ ==__c3
__b__you could look at the web site .__c3
__s^2__okay .__c0
__s^2__i'll ==__c3
__b__okay .__c0
__b__and the ad- - and - and the deadline is the fifteenth of june .__c3
__s__i don't know about it .__c0
__s^df__yeah | that's pretty soon .__c0
__b__huh .__c4
__s^df.%--__hey plenty of time .__c3
__b__why we've got over a week !__c4
__s^e^rt__it would be nice to go write two papers actually .__c3
__b__yeah and one - one from your perspective and one from our peve- - per- - per- ==__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__b__i mean th- - that's the kind of thing that maybe like um the general uh con- - sort of like n. t. l. ish like whatever the previous simulation based pers- - maybe you're talking about the same kind of thing a general paper about the approach here would probably be appropriate .__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__%--__and good to do at some point anyway .__c0
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^df__um ==__c0
__s^df__well | i - i also think that if we sort of write about what we have done in the past six months we - we - we could sort of craft a nice little paper that if it gets rejected which could happen doesn't hurt .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__fh__because it's something we uh ==__c3
__s__having it is still a good thing .__c0
__s^na__having it is a good - good thing .__c3
__s.%--__yeah .__c0
__b__it's a nice exercise .__c3
__b__it's ==__c3
__s^na^r__i usually enjoy writing papers .__c3
__fh__it's not - i don't re- - regard it as a painful thing .__c3
__s.%--__uhhuh | it's fun .__c0
__s^no__and um we should all do more for our publication lists .__c3
__s__and | it just never hurts .__c3
__s^df__and | keith and or johno will go probably .__c3
__b__will i ?__c1
__%--__when is it and where ?__c0
__b__huh .__c4
__s^rt__in case of ==__c3
__fh__it's on the twenty second of september in saarbruecken germany .__c3
__b__uh | it's in germany .__c0
__s:s^fe__uh okay i s- - i see .__c0
__s:qw__tomasello's already in germany anyway .__c0
__s^rt__so makes sense | okay .__c0
__s.%-__just ==__c4
__s^bk__um okay .__c0
__s^aa__so is the - what - are you just talking about you know the details of how to do it or whether to do it or what it would be ?__c0
__s^df__what would one possibly put in such a paper .__c4
__b__what to write about .__c3
__s^bk__or what to write about .__c0
__s__what is our - what's our take home message .__c3
__s.%--__what - what do we actually ==__c3
__s__because i mean it - i don't like papers where you just talk about what you plan to do .__c3
__b__i mean it's obvious that we can't do any kind of evaluation .__c3
__s^e__and have no - you know we can't write an a. c. l type paper where we say okay we've done this .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__s^bk__and now we're whatever percentage better than everybody else | you know .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__b__it's far too early for that .__c3
__s^e__but uh we - we can tell them what we think .__c3
__b__i mean that's ==__c3
__b__never hurts to try .__c3
__fh__and um ==__c3
__s^bk__maybe even - that's maybe the time to introduce the - the new formalism that you guys have cooked up .__c3
__%-__uhhuh .__c0
__s.%--__are in the process of ==__c4
__s__but that ==__c1
__s^e__how many pages ?__c0
__s^df__don't they need to finish the formalism ?__c1
__s^aa__it's just like four pages .__c3
__s^ba__four pages ?__c0
__s^na__i mean it's - it's not even a h- ==__c3
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s^ba__okay | so it's a little thing .__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s__oh .__c0
__b__well you said it was four thousand lines .__c1
__b__oh .__c4
__fh__is that what you s- ?==__c1
__%--__okay | four pages is like really not very much space .__c0
__s^bu__i don't know .__c3
__s^aa__w- - did you look at it ?__c3
__s^aa__yeah | it depends on the format .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__oh my gosh | oh i thought you were - i thought we were talking about something .__c4
__b__which was much more like ten or something .__c4
__s^aa__no | that's - i mean that's actually a problem .__c3
__s^aa|s__it's difficu- - it's more difficult to write on four pages than on eight .__c3
__s^aa^r__it's ==__c0
__s^ba__yeah .__c0
__b__yeah .__c4
__s.%--__and it's also difficult to - even if you had a lot of substance it's hard to demonstrate that in four pages basically .__c0
__s__yeah .__c4
__s^e__um ==__c0
__b__that would be hard .__c4
__s.%--__well i uh maybe it's just four thousand lines .__c3
__qy^rt__i mean it's still - it's still ==__c0
__s__i do- - i don't - they don't want any ==__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__they don't have a tex f- - style @@ guide .__c3
__qw__uhhuh uhhuh .__c0
__s^na__they just want ascii .__c3
__s^aa__pure ascii lines .__c3
__s^bk__okay .__c0
__b__whatever .__c3
__s^aa__why for whatever reason .__c3
__%--__i don't know .__c3
__fh__not including figures and such ?__c0
__s^bu__i don't know .__c3
__s^aa__very unspecific unfortunately .__c3
__s^aa__okay .__c0
__qy^d^g__well ==__c0
__s__we'll just uh ==__c3
__fh__i would say that's closer to six pages actually .__c1
__s__four thousand lines of ascii ?__c1
__s__okay then .__c3
__s^rt__four thousand lines .__c4
__b__it's ==__c3
__b__i mean | isn't a- - isn't it about fifty s- - fifty five sixty lines to a page ?__c4
__s^df__i d- - don't quote me on this .__c3
__b__this is numbers i - i have from looking o- ==__c3
__s__how many characters are on a line ?__c1
__s__okay .__c3
__s^e__ascii ?__c0
__s__let's - let's - wh- - wh- - what should we - should - should we uh um discuss this over tea ?__c3
__fh__and all of us look at the web .__c3
__s^ba__oh i can't .__c3
__s^bk__i'm wizarding today .__c3
__qy^d^rt__okay | look at the web page .__c0
__s__um ==__c3
__b__wha- - w- ==__c0
__s^df.%--__look at the web page | and let's talk about it maybe tomorrow afternoon .__c3
__s^e__more cues for us to find it are like neural cons- ==__c0
__s.%--__johno will send you a link .__c3
__s^aa__oh you have a link | okay okay .__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__i got an email .__c1
__s^rt__okay .__c0
__b__by the way keith is comfortable with us calling him cool keith .__c1
__s^no__oh cool keith .__c0
__s^ba__he - he decided i'm chilling in the five one o. .__c4
__s^na__cool cool keith .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c4
__s^na__excellent .__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__okay .__c3
__s^no__that's a very cool t. shirt .__c0
__s^df__thank you .__c4
__s^no__and i'm also flying ==__c3
__s^na__i got this from the two one two .__c4
__fh__new york ?__c0
__%--__excellent .__c0
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__sorry | yes ?__c0
__s^na__i'm flying to sicily next in a w- - two weeks from now .__c3
__b__oh | lucky you .__c0
__b__w- - and a week of business in germany .__c3
__s__i should mention that for you .__c3
__s.%--__and otherwise you haven't missed much .__c3
__s__except for a really weird idea .__c3
__s__but you'll hear about that soon enough ==__c3
__b__the idea that you and i already know about ?__c0
__qy^bh__that you already told me .__c0
__s^no__not that ==__c0
__s^no__no no no .__c3
__s__okay .__c0
__b__yeah | that is something for the rest of the gang to - to g- ==__c3
__s^ba__the thing with the goats and the helicopters ?__c4
__b__change the watchband .__c3
__fh__it's time to walk the sheep .__c3
__b__like ==__c2
__s__okay .__c0
__s^bk__um ==__c3
__s__did you catch that allusion ?__c3
__s^e__it's time to walk the sheep .__c3
__fh__no .__c4
__b__it's a- - a- - uh presumably one of the watergate codes they uh ==__c3
__b__oh .__c4
__fg|s__anyways | th- ==__c3
__s^aa__um um ==__c3
__s^na__don't make any plans for spring break next year .__c3
__b__that's ==__c3
__fh__oh shoot .__c4
__fh__that's the other thing .__c3
__s.%--__we're going to do an int- - e. d. u internal workshop in sicily .__c3
__s.%--__that's what - that's what he says .__c0
__s__i've already got the funding .__c3
__s__i kn- - that's great .__c0
__s^aa__so i mean ==__c3
__s^aa__does that mean - does that mean you'll get - you'll fly us there ?__c0
__s__we'll see .__c4
__s^ba__no that's ==__c3
__s^bk__yeah | that's what it means .__c3
__s^ba__hhh !__c0
__s^bk__okay | cool .__c0
__s.%-__huh .__c4
__s__uh- - a- - a- ==__c0
__b__and he'll put us up too .__c1
__s__i know - i know about that part .__c0
__s^nd__i know about the - the almond trees and stuff .__c0
__s^r__not joking .__c0
__b__okay .__c3
__b__name a vegetable .__c0
__b__okay oh um | kiwi .__c0
__fg|s__yeah .__c4
__b__huh too easy .__c3
__s^na__coconut .__c0
__s^na__ki- ==__c3
__s^aa__pineapple .__c0
__s^aa__see ?__c0
__fh__mango .__c0
__s^na__too easy .__c3
__b__okay okay | too easy ?__c0
__s^e__yeah | mangos go everywhere .__c3
__b__so do kiwi .__c3
__s__really ?__c0
__s^bk__oh | okay but i was trying to find something that he didn't grow on his farm .__c0
__s^bk__but coconut anana- - pineapple that's - that's tricky | yeah .__c3
__qy^bh__sorry .__c0
__s__anyway ==__c0
__s__cantaloupe .__c0
__b__so but we have to decide what like sort of the general idea of ==__c4
__s^aa|s^na__potatoes .__c1
__b__so sorry .__c1
__b__@@ .__c4
__b__um ==__c4
__fh|s__i mean we're going to have an example case .__c4
__s^bu__um | right ?__c4
__b__i m- - the - the point is to - like this where is case or something .__c4
__s^na__yeah | maybe you have - it would be kind of - the paper ha- - would have in my vision a nice flow if we could say well here is th- - the - th- - here is parsing if you want to do it c- - right .__c3
__s^na__here is understanding if you want to do it right .__c3
__b__and you know - without going into technical ==__c3
__s^2__uhhuh .__c4
__s.%-__but then in the end we're not doing like those things right yet | right ?__c0
__b__would that be clear in the paper or not ?__c0
__s^2__that would be clear .__c3
__s^bk__we would ==__c3
__s__i - i mailed around a little paper that i have .__c3
__s.%-__okay .__c0
__fh__it would be like this is the idea .__c0
__s__w- - we could sort of say this is ==__c3
__b__oh i didn't get that .__c0
__fh__did i ?__c0
__s^e__oops .__c0
__s__no .__c3
__b__did i ?__c0
__s__oops sorry .__c0
__b__no | y- - i don't think you got it .__c1
__s^2__see this if you- - if you're not around and don't partake in the discussions and you don't get any email .__c3
__b__i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry sorry .__c0
__b__and ==__c3
__s^ba__okay go on .__c0
__s.%-__so parsing done right is like chicken done right .__c0
__s__su- ==__c3
__s^ba__so we could - we could say this is what - what's sort of state of the art today | nuh ?__c3
__s__okay .__c0
__fh__and say this is bad | nuh ?__c3
__qr^bu^d__yeah .__c0
__s^ar|s__and then we can say uh well what we do is this .__c3
__s__okay .__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__b__parsing done right interpretation done right example .__c0
__s^aa__uhhuh yeah | and ==__c3
__s__and how much to get into the cognitive neural part ?__c0
__s__we- ==__c3
__s^bk__that's the only - that's the question mark .__c1
__s^aa__don't you need to reduce it if it's a - or reduce it if it's a cognitive neuro ?==__c1
__s^e.%-__well you don't have t- ==__c0
__s__i mean the conference may be cognitive neural .__c0
__s^aa|s^na.%--__doesn't mean that every paper has to be both .__c0
__b__yeah | and you can - you can just point to the - to the literature .__c3
__s__huh .__c4
__s^df^rt__like n. l. p cognitive neural .__c0
__s__you can say that construction based @@ .__c3
__fh__you know ==__c3
__s__so i- - so this paper wouldn't particularly deal with that side .__c0
__s^e__although it could reference the n. t. l. ish sort of like um approach .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk__yeah .__c0
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__s__the fact that the methods here are all compatible with or designed to be compatible with whatever neurological - neuro- - neuro-biol- - su- - stuff .__c0
__s^e__uhhuh .__c3
__b__yeah | i guess four pages you could ==__c0
__s__@@ i mean you could definitely - it's definitely possible to do it .__c0
__b__it's just - it'd just be small .__c0
__%--__like introducing the formalism might be not really possible in detail .__c0
__fh__but you can use an example of it .__c0
__s^ba__well l- - looking at ==__c4
__s.%--__yeah | looking at that paper that - that you had i mean you know like you didn't really explain in detail what was going on in the x. m. l cases or whatever .__c4
__s__you just sort of said well you know here's the general idea .__c4
__s__some stuff gets put in there .__c4
__qw^rt__you know hopefully you can - you can say something like constituents tells you what the construction is made out of you know without going into this intense detail .__c4
__%__yeah yeah .__c0
__%__so it be like using the formalism rather than you know introducing it per se .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__h|s__so ==__c0
__s__give them the one paragraph whirlwind tour of w- - w- - what this is for .__c4
__fh__yeah .__c0
__b__and - yeah .__c4
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c3
__s.%__and people will sort of figure out or ask about the bits that are implicit .__c0
__s__yeah .__c3
__s.%-__so this will be sort of documenting what we think and documenting what we have in terms of the bayes-net stuff .__c3
__s^rt__uhhuh .__c0
__s^e.%--__and since there's never a bad idea to document things | no ?__c3
__s^rt__that's th- - that's definitely a good idea .__c0
__s^bk__that would be my uh ==__c3
__s^bk__we - we should sketch out the details maybe tomorrow afternoon-ish if everyone is around .__c3
__s__i don't know .__c3
__s^aa__i think so .__c4
__s^bk__you probably wouldn't be part of it .__c3
__s^bk__maybe you want ==__c3
__s__think about it .__c3
__b__um ==__c3
__s^aa__you may - may ruin your career forever if you appear .__c3
__s^bk__yeah | you might get blacklisted .__c1
__s^bk__and um ==__c3
__s^fa__the uh other thing ==__c3
__%__yeah | we actually have we made any progress on what we decided uh last week ?__c3
__s__i'm sure you read the transcript of last week's meeting in red .__c3
__s^arp__so sh- - so you're up to dated - caught up .__c3
__s__no | sorry .__c0
__b__we decided t- - that we're going to take a where is something question .__c3
__s^bk__and pretend we have parsed it .__c3
__s^bk|%--__and see what we could possibly hope to observe on the discourse side .__c3
__s^bk__remember i came in and i started asking you about how we were sor- - going to sort out the uh decision nodes ?__c1
__s^bk__yes .__c0
__fh|qy.%--__what'd you say ?__c0
__s__i remember you talking to me just not what you said .__c1
__qy^rt__i do remember you talking to me .__c0
__h|s^aa__um ==__c0
__s^aa__a few more bits .__c0
__s^aa__well there was like we needed to - or uh in my opinion we need to design a bayes - another sub-bayes-net .__c1
__s^ba__you know it was whether - it was whether we would have a bayes-net on the output and on the input .__c1
__fh__oh .__c0
__s__or whether the construction was going to be in the bayes-net .__c1
__b__oh yeah okay .__c0
__s^ba^na__a- - and outside of it .__c1
__s__and ==__c1
__b__okay .__c0
__s__so that was - was that the question ?__c0
__s^aa__was that what ?==__c0
__s^aa__well that was related to what we were talking about .__c1
__b__should i introduce it as sudo-square ?__c3
__s^na__yeah sure .__c1
__fg__we have to put this in the paper .__c3
__s^no__if we write it .__c3
__s^ba__this is - this is my only constraint .__c3
__s__the - th- ==__c3
__fh__so ==__c3
__s__the sudo-square is situation user discourse right ontology .__c3
__s__oh i saw the diagram in the office .__c4
__s^rt__oh my god that's amazing !__c0
__s^e__huh .__c3
__s^rt__yeah whatever .__c3
__s.%--__no way !__c0
__b__way .__c4
__s.%--__is it ?__c3
__s^rt__someone's going to start making phil collins jokes .__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s^na__huh ?__c3
__s__sorry .__c0
__fh__oh god i hope not .__c4
__s__what ?__c1
__s__you guys are too young .__c0
__fh__you know like sussudio .__c4
__s__that horrible horrible song that should never have been created .__c4
__b__yeah come on .__c0
__%--__oh oh oh oh .__c1
__%-__i know that was horrible .__c0
__s__i've blocked every aspect of phil collins out of my mind .__c1
__s__sussudio .__c0
__fg__what ?__c2
__s^aap__i'm sorry i haven't .__c0
__s^df__not on purpose .__c0
__b__@@ in here .__c4
__s^ba__oh - well also he's talking about suicide .__c3
__b__and that's - that's not a notion i want to have evoked .__c3
__s^ba__no he's not .__c0
__fh__he is .__c3
__b__really ?__c0
__%__oops | i didn't really listen to it .__c0
__%--__the ==__c3
__fh__i was too young .__c0
__%--__huh .__c4
__s.%--__it sounds too rocking for that .__c4
__s__anyway ==__c0
__s__yeah .__c0
__b__anyway | so what's going on here ?__c4
__b__so what are - what ?==__c4
__b__was wollte der kuenstler uns damit sagen ?__c4
__s^aa__so ==__c3
__fg|qy^rt__stop excluding me .__c0
__s^e__okay | so we have tons of little things here .__c3
__qrr^rt__and we've ==__c3
__s.%--__i can't believe that that's never been thought of before .__c0
__s^df__wait what are the dots ?__c1
__b__i don't remember what the dots were .__c1
__s^df__those are little bugs .__c4
__s^df__okay .__c3
__s^e__cool keith .__c0
__s^e__you know these are our whatever belief net decision nodes .__c3
__s^fe__@@ ==__c0
__fh__and they all contribute to these things down here .__c3
__s__oh oh .__c1
__qy^d^f^g__wait wait | what's the middle thing ?__c0
__b__that's e. d. u .__c3
__s__that's a c- ==__c4
__b__e- - e- - our e- - e- - e- ==__c3
__fh__but wh- - i mean ==__c0
__s__that's ==__c4
__fh__you .__c3
__s^e__we .__c3
__fh|s__us .__c3
__b__but what is it ?__c0
__s^co__well in the moment it's a bayes-net .__c3
__b__and it has sort of fifty not yet specified interfaces .__c3
__b__okay | uh i have taken care that we actually can build little interfaces to other modules that will tell us whether the user likes these things and n- - the - or these things .__c3
__s^2__and he - whether he's in a wheelchair or not .__c3
__s^2__okay .__c0
__b__is that supposed to be the international sign for interface ?__c0
__b__i think so | yeah .__c3
__b__huh okay .__c0
__s^bk__i'd - i'd never seen it before either .__c1
__s^bk__okay just t- ==__c0
__s__cool .__c0
__s__huh so ==__c3
__s^fa|qw^br__because things fit onto that | see ?__c4
__s^r__yeah .__c0
__b__cool .__c0
__s.%--__in a vaguely obscene fashion .__c4
__qy^bu^rt__no | this is a r. m. e core by agent design .__c3
__qy^bu^rt__i don't know .__c3
__s^aa__that's so great .__c0
__s^bu|qy^d^g^rt__there's maybe a different ==__c3
__s^e__so wait .__c4
__s^no.%-__what a- - what are these letters again ?__c4
__fg|%-__situr- - situation user discourse and ==__c4
__b__situation user d- - ontology .__c3
__s^na__user ?__c0
__s__ontology .__c4
__s.%--__what about the utterance ?__c0
__b__that's here .__c3
__s^bk__it's ==__c4
__s^bs__discourse .__c2
__b__oh discourse .__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__discourse is all things linguistic | yeah .__c4
__s^bs__so that's not like context | okay .__c0
__s^2.%--__so this - this includes the - the current utterance plus all the previous utterances .__c3
__s__interesting .__c0
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c0
__s__user .__c0
__b__and for example w- - i- - s- - i- - irena gurevich is going to be here uh end of july .__c3
__s^e__user .__c0
__b__she's a new linguist working for e. m. l .__c3
__%--__and what she would like to do for example is great for us .__c3
__b__she would like to take the ent- - ontolog- ==__c3
__s^df__ouch .__c2
__s__so ==__c3
__s^bk__we have discussed in terms of the eva ==__c3
__s^bk__grateful for us ?__c0
__s^bk__uh ==__c3
__s.%--__did you just say grateful for us ?__c0
__s^bsc__okay sorry .__c0
__s__anyway ==__c0
__s^aa__think of - back at the eva vector .__c3
__s__and johno coming up with the idea that if the person discussed the - discussed the admission fee in - uh previously that might be a good indication that how do i get to the castle ? actually he wants to enter .__c3
__s^e__uhhuh .__c0
__s^na__or you know how do i get to x.  .__c3
__s^m__discussing the admission fee in the previous utterance is a good indication .__c3
__%__uhhuh .__c4
__s^na.%--__@@ ==__c0
__b__so ==__c3
__s^aa__we don't want a hard code a set of lexemes or things that person's you know sort of filter or uh search the discourse history .__c3
__fg__uhhuh .__c0
__s__so what would be kind of cool is that if we encounter concepts that are castle tower bank hotel we run it through the ontology .__c3
__fg__and the ontology tells us it has um admission opening times .__c3
__s^aa__it has admission fees .__c3
__s^m__it has this it has that .__c3
__s^aa__and then we - we - we make a thesaurus lexicon look up .__c3
__s^aa__and then search dynamically through the uh discourse history for occurrences of these things in a given window of utterances .__c3
__%__uhhuh .__c0
__b__and that might you know give us additional input to belief a.  versus b.  .__c3
__s__or e.  versus a.  .__c3
__b__so it's not just a particular word's ==__c0
__s__okay | so the - you're looking for a few keys that you know are cues to - sorry a few specific cues to some intention .__c0
__s^aa__you can dynamically look up keys | yeah .__c1
__s^df__yeah .__c3
__s__uh so wait - so um since this - since this sort of technical stuff is going over my head .__c4
__s.%-__okay .__c0
__b__and then grep basically .__c1
__b__the - the point is that you uh - that when someone's talking about a castle you know that it's the sort of thing that people are likely to want to go into ?__c4
__s__or is it the fact that if there's an admission fee then one of the things we know about admission fees is that you pay them in order to go in ?__c4
__s^aa__and then the idea of entering is active in the discourse or something and then .__c4
__b__well ==__c3
__b__blah blah blah .__c4
__s__i mean ==__c4
__s__the - the idea is even more general .__c3
__s__the idea is to say we encounter a certain entity in a - in a- - in a utterance .__c3
__s^e__so le- - let's look up everything we - the ontology gives us about that entity .__c3
__s^e__what stuff it does what roles it has .__c3
__b__what parts whatever it has .__c3
__s__functions .__c3
__s:qw__and then we look in the discourse whether any of that or any surface structure corresponding to these roles functions ah has ever occurred .__c3
__s__oh okay .__c4
__s__and then the discourse history can t- - tell us yeah or no .__c3
__s__okay .__c4
__b__and then it's up for us to decide what to do with it .__c3
__b__okay .__c4
__s__t- - so i- ==__c3
__s__so ==__c4
__s.%--__no go ahead .__c4
__b__so we may think that if you say um where is the theater um whether or not he has talked about tickets before then we - he's probably want to go there to see something .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s__okay .__c4
__b__or where is the opera in par- - paris .__c3
__s^rt__yeah .__c3
__qy^d^f^g__lots of people go to the opera to take pictures of it and to look at it .__c3
__s^bk__uhhuh okay .__c4
__b__and lots of people go to attend a performance .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s^e__and the discourse can maybe tell us w- - what's more likely if we know what to look for in previous statements .__c3
__s^df__and so we can hard code for opera look for tickets look for this look for that .__c3
__b__okay .__c4
__s^e.%--__okay .__c4
__b__or look for mozart look for thi- ==__c3
__s^rt__but the smarter way is to go via the ontology .__c3
__s^bk|s.%-__and dynamically then look up u- - stuff .__c3
__s__okay | but you're still doing look up so that when the person - so the point is that when the person says where is it then you sort of say let's go back and look at other things and then decide .__c4
__qy^bh__rather than the other possibility which is that all through discourse as they talk about different things .__c4
__s__you know like w- ==__c4
__b__prior to the where is it question they say you know how much does it cost to get in you know to - to see a movie around here .__c4
__b__um | where is the closest theater .__c4
__s^df.%-__the - the - the point is that by mentioning admission fees that just sort of stays active now .__c4
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^ba__you know that becomes part of like their sort of current ongoing active conceptual structure .__c4
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c3
__s__and then um over in your bayes-net or whatever when - when the person says where is it you've already got you know since they were talking about admission and that evokes the idea of entering um then when they go and ask where is it then you're enter node is already active .__c4
__b__because that's what the person is thinking about .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^ba__i mean that's the sort of cognitive linguistic y way .__c4
__s:s__and probably not practical .__c4
__b__yeah | e- - ultimately that's also what we want to get at .__c3
__s^ba__i think that's - that's the correct way .__c3
__s__so of course we have to keep memory of what was the last intention .__c3
__qy^bh__uhhuh .__c4
__b__and how does it fit to this and what does it tell us in terms of - of the - the - what we're examining .__c3
__s__huh yeah .__c4
__b__and furthermore i mean we can idealize that you know people don't change topics .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__qy^rt__but they do .__c3
__b__but even th- - for that there is a student of ours who's doing a dialogue act um recognition module .__c3
__qrr__right .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__b__so maybe we're even in a position where we can take your approach .__c3
__s__which is of course much better as to say how - how do these pieces ?==__c3
__qy^bh__huh .__c4
__s^bk__and much harder to r- - program .__c4
__s^bk__huh ?__c3
__fh__and much harder to p- - to program .__c4
__s^bk__yeah | how - how do these pieces fit together .__c3
__qy^bh__uhhuh .__c3
__s__and um ==__c3
__fg__but okay nevertheless so these are issues .__c3
__s.%-__but we - what we actually decided last week is to and this is again for your benefit is to um pretend we have observed and parsed an utterance such as where is the powder tower .__c3
__s__or where is the zoo .__c3
__s^df__and specify um what - what we think the - the output uh observe out - i- - input nodes for our bayes-nets for the sub- - sub d. for the discourse bit should be .__c3
__s^aa__so that - and i will - i will then come up with the ontology side uh bits and pieces .__c3
__b__so that we can say okay we - we always just look at this utterance .__c3
__fh__that's the only utterance we can do .__c3
__s__it's hard coded .__c3
__fg__like srini sort of hand parsed .__c3
__b__hand crafted .__c3
__b__but this is what we hope to be able to observe in general from utterances and from ontologies .__c3
__fh__and then we can sort of fiddle with these things to see what it actually produces in terms of output .__c3
__s^aa__uh .__c4
__s__so | we need to find out what the where is x.  construction will give us in terms of semantics .__c3
__b__and simspec type things .__c3
__b__just ==__c0
__b__okay | just where is x.  ?__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__b__or any variants of that .__c0
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__no !__c3
__s^2__um look at it this way .__c3
__b__i- ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^aa__what did we decide ?__c3
__s^e:s__we decided sort of the - the prototypical where is x.  where you know we don't really know does he want to go there or just want to know where it is .__c3
__s__well we were ==__c4
__b__so the difference of where is the railway station versus where - where - where is greenland | nuh .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s^df__uh s- - i was just dancing | sorry .__c1
__qy__we're not videotaping any of this .__c3
__b__so ==__c3
__s^na__uh - uh .__c1
__s^na__so | um we're supposed to ==__c4
__%__i mean we're talking about sort of anything that has the semantics of request for location | right ?__c4
__b.%__actually ==__c4
__b.%__or ==__c4
__s^na__i mean anyway the node in the uh - the ultimate uh in - in the bayes-net thing when you're done the - the node that we're talking about um is one that says request for location true or something like that | right ?__c4
__s^na__um and - and exactly how that gets activated you know like whether we want the sentence how do i get there to activate that node or not you know that's - that's sort of the issue that sort of the linguistic y side has to deal with | right .__c4
__s__yeah | but it ==__c3
__b__yea- - nnn- ==__c3
__fg__well actually more - m- - more the other way around .__c3
__s__we wanted something that represents uncertainty uh we- - in terms of going there or just wanting to know where it is for example .__c3
__b__some generic information .__c3
__s__okay .__c4
__fh__and so this is prototypically @@ found in the where is something question surface structure .__c3
__s__okay .__c4
__s^no__we- ==__c1
__b__which can be p- - you know should be maps to something that activates both .__c3
__fg|s^tc__i mean the idea is to ==__c3
__s.%--__i don't ==__c1
__s__all right okay .__c4
__qy^bh__hhh .__c1
__b__let's have it fit nicely with the paper .__c3
__qw.%--__i guess i don't ==__c1
__s^df^j__i don't see unde- - how we would be able to distinguish between the two intentions just from the g- - utterance though .__c1
__fh__the ==__c3
__s__i mean uh bef- - or before we don't - before we cranked it through the bayes-net .__c1
__s__i mean ==__c1
__fh__yeah | we - we wouldn't .__c3
__b__that's exactly what we want .__c3
__s^cs^rt__we want to get ==__c3
__b__we would ?__c1
__fh|s^no__no | we wouldn't .__c3
__s^cs__okay .__c1
__s__but then so basically it's just a - for every construction we have a node in the net | right ?__c1
__s^nd__and we turn on that node .__c1
__s^nd__yeah .__c3
__%__oy .__c4
__s^nd__what - what is this going to ?==__c3
__qy^d__exactly .__c3
__s^na__what is the uh ?==__c3
__s^bk__well ==__c3
__s^df__and then given that we know that the construction has these two things we can set up probabilities .__c1
__s^df^no^rt__we can s- - basically define all the tables for ev- - for those .__c1
__fh|s__yeah | it should be - so we have ==__c3
__s^na__um ==__c3
__s^bk__i- - let's assume we - we call something like a loc x. node and a path x. node .__c3
__s__and what we actually get if we just look at the discourse where is x.  should activate .__c3
__fh__or should ==__c3
__s^bk__huh .__c4
__s^ba__huh | should be both .__c3
__s^cs__whereas maybe where is x.  located we find from the data is always just asked when the person wants to know where it is .__c3
__%-__and how do i get to is always asked when the person just wants to know how to get there .__c3
__s.%-__right ?__c3
__s^aap__so we want to sort of come up with what gets uh input and how inter- - in case of a where is question .__c3
__s^df__so what - what would the outcome of - of your parser look like ?__c3
__s^bk__and what other discourse information from the discourse history could we hope to get squeeze out of that utterance ?__c3
__s^df__so define the - the input into the bayes-net based on what the utterance where is x.  gives us .__c3
__s^fe__so definitely have an entity node here which is activated via the ontology .__c3
__s^ba__s- ==__c0
__%-__so where is x.  produces something that is s- - stands for x.  whether it's castle bank restroom toilet whatever .__c3
__fh__and then the ontology will tell us ==__c3
__s^ft__that it has a location or something like that .__c0
__s^bd__or th- - the ontology will tell us where actually it is located .__c0
__b__no | not at all .__c3
__qh__okay .__c0
__s^bk__where it is located we have a user proximity node here somewhere .__c3
__fh|s__okay okay .__c0
__s^df__e- - which tells us how far the user - how far away the user is in respect to that uh entity .__c3
__s__okay .__c0
__qy^cs^rt__so you're talking about for instance the construction obviously involves this entity or refers - refers to this entity .__c0
__s^ar__uhhuh .__c3
__s^ar__and from the construction also you know that it is a location .__c0
__s^ar__is - or a thing - thing that can be located .__c0
__s^bk__right ontology says this thing has a location slot .__c0
__s.%-__sh- - and that's the thing that is being - that is the content of the question that's being queried by one interpretation of where is x.  .__c0
__s^ar__and another one is um path from current - user current location to that location .__c0
__s^ng__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk^fe__so ==__c0
__s^bk^fe__so is the question ?==__c0
__s^bk__i mean it's just that i'm not sure what the ==__c0
__s__is the question for this particular construction how we specify that that's the information it provides ?__c0
__s^fe__or - or asked for ?__c0
__s^cs__b- - both sides | right ?__c0
__b__yeah you don't need to even do that .__c3
__s^fe__it's just sort of what - what would be @@ observed in uh - in that case .__c3
__b__observed when you heard the speaker say where is x.  or when - when that's been parsed ?__c0
__s^cs.%-__uhhuh .__c3
__s__so these little circles you have by the d.  .__c0
__qy^rt__is that ?==__c0
__s^bk|s.%-__that's exactly what we're looking for .__c3
__s^cs__okay okay .__c0
__s^ba__i d- - i just - i don't like having - characterizing the constructions with location and path .__c1
__s__or li- - characterizing them like that .__c1
__s^na__because you don't - it seems like in the general case you wouldn't know how - how to characterize them .__c1
__s__you wouldn't .__c3
__b__i mean - or for when .__c1
__s^na^r__there could be an interpretation that we don't have a node for in the ==__c1
__b__i mean it just seems like @@ has to have uh - a node for the construction and then let the chips fall where they may .__c1
__s^na__versus uh saying this construction either can mean location or path .__c1
__b__and in this cas- - and since - since it can mean either of those things it would light both of those up .__c1
__s__it's the same .__c3
__fh__thoughts ?__c1
__s^bk|s__questions ?__c1
__b__i'm thinking about it .__c4
__s__um ==__c4
__s^j__it will be the same .__c3
__s__so i think r- - in here we have i'll go there | right .__c3
__s^j__answers ?__c1
__fg__and we have our info on .__c3
__fh__so in my c- - my case this would sort of make this happy and this would make the go there happy .__c3
__s^bk__what you're saying is we have a where x. question where x. node that makes both happy .__c3
__qw__right ?__c3
__s^e__that's what you're proposing which is in my mind .__c3
__qy.%-__just as fine .__c3
__s^na__so w- - if we have a construction node where is x.  it's going to both get the po- - posterior probability that - it's info on up .__c3
__s^bk__huh yeah .__c1
__s^na__info on is true up and that go there is true up as well .__c3
__s^aa__which would be exactly analogous to what i'm proposing is this makes uh makes something here true .__c3
__s^ba__and this makes something - also something here true .__c3
__b__and this makes this true up and this makes this true up as well .__c3
__s^na__i kind of like it better without that extra level of indirection too .__c4
__s__you know with - with this points to this points to that and so on .__c4
__b__because i don't know it ==__c4
__s^tc__yeah | because we get - we get tons of constructions i think .__c3
__s.%--__is- - uh ==__c0
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__because you know huh people have many ways of asking for the same thing .__c3
__fh__yeah sure .__c1
__fh|s__yeah .__c0
__qy.%--__and ==__c3
__s^ng__so un- ==__c0
__qy.%--__i change- - i changed my mind actually .__c1
__s.%--__okay .__c4
__qy.%-__so | i agree with that .__c0
__s__i have a different kind of question .__c0
__s^rt__might be related .__c0
__qy^bu^rt__which is okay so implicitly everything in e. d. u we're always inferring the speaker intent | right ?__c0
__s^na__like what they want .__c0
__s^e__either the information that they want or ==__c0
__s^bk__it's always information that they want probably of some kind .__c0
__%__right ?__c0
__s^bk__or i - i don't know .__c0
__s^aa__the system doesn't massage you | no no .__c3
__s^aa__or what's something that they ==__c0
__s^aa|s^na__i - i - i don't ==__c0
__s^e__okay .__c0
__s__so um ==__c0
__b__let's see .__c0
__%-__so i don't know if the - i mean i- - if th- - just there's more s- - here that's not shown that you - it's already like part of the system whatever .__c0
__s^bu|qy^d^g^rt__but where is x.  like the fact that it is you know a speech act whatever ==__c0
__qy__it is a question .__c0
__s^aa__it's a question that um queries on some particular thing x.  .__c0
__s^e__and x.  is that location .__c0
__s^na__there's like a lot of structure in representing that .__c0
__s^aa__yep yeah .__c3
__s^aa__so that seems different from just having the node location x. .__c0
__s^na__and that goes into edu | right ?__c0
__b__yeah precisely .__c3
__s.%-__that's - that's ==__c3
__s.%-__so w- ==__c3
__s^aa__so tha- - is that what you're t- - talking about ?__c0
__s.%--__exactly | we have su- - we have specified two .__c3
__s^nd__wh- - what kinds of structure we want .__c0
__qw__okay the next one would be here just for mood .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c0
__s^na__the next one would be what we can squeeze out of the uh ==__c3
__s^aa__i don't know maybe we want to observe the uh um uh the length of - of the words used and or the prosody .__c3
__s^bk__huh .__c0
__s__and g- - a- - and t- - make conclusions about the user's intelligence .__c3
__s^aa__okay | so in some ways ==__c0
__s^aa__i don't know .__c3
__b__yeah .__c3
__b__um | so in some ways in the other sort of parallel set of mo- - more linguistic meetings we've been talking about possible semantics of some construction .__c0
__s^e__uhhuh .__c4
__s^aa__right ?__c0
__s^bk__where it was ==__c0
__s^bu|qy^d^g.%__the simulation that's according to it - you know that - that corresponds to it and as well the - as discourse .__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__b__whatever conte- - infor- - in- - discourse information .__c0
__s__such as the mood .__c0
__s^aa|s^na__and you know other stuff .__c0
__s^e__so are we looking for a sort of abbreviation of that that's tailored to this problem ?__c0
__b__because that - that has you know basically you know s- - it's in progress still .__c0
__%__it's in development still .__c0
__fh__but it definitely has various feature slots attributes um bindings between things .__c0
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c3
__s^aa^r__u- - that's exactly r- - um why i'm proposing - it's too early to have - to think of them - of all of these discourse things that one could possibly observe .__c3
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__s^aa^r__so let's just assume ==__c3
__s__for the subset of ==__c0
__%__human beings are not allowed to ask anything but where is x.  .__c3
__b__okay .__c0
__fh__this is the only utterance in the world .__c3
__s^aa__what could we observe from that ?__c3
__s^ba__okay | that exactly where is x.  .__c0
__b__in ter- ==__c3
__s^ba__not the - the choices of where is x.  or how do i get to x.  .__c0
__fh__just where is x.  .__c0
__s^na__yeah .__c4
__s^ba__just - just where is x.  .__c3
__s.%--__okay .__c0
__s__and but you know do it - do it in such a way that we know that people can also say is the town hall in front of the bank ==so that we need something like a w- - w. h focus | nuh .__c3
__s^bk__should be - should be there that you know this - the - whatever we get from the ==__c3
__b__wait so do or do not take other kinds of constructions into account ?__c0
__fh|s^e__well if you - if you can - oh definitely do .__c3
__s^t3__okay | where possible .__c0
__s__where possible | right ?__c3
__s^ba__okay .__c0
__b__if i- - if - if it's not at all triggered by our thing then it's irrelevant .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__s^ba^fe^r__and it doesn't hurt to leave it out for the moment .__c3
__s^aap^rt__um but ==__c3
__s^ba^r__okay .__c0
__s^bk__um it seems like for instance where is x.  the fact that it might mean um tell me how to get to x.  ==__c0
__b__like ==__c0
__s.%--__do y- - so would you want to say that those two are both like ?==__c0
__s^df^j__those are the two interpretations | right .__c0
__s^df__the - the ones that are location or path .__c0
__b__so you could say that the s- - construction is a question asking about this location .__c0
__s^na__and then you can additionally infer if they're asking about the location it's because they want to go to that place .__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c3
__s^df__in which case the - you're jumping a step - step and saying oh i know where it is .__c0
__fg__yeah .__c4
__qw__but i also know how to get - they want to seem - they seem to want to get there so i'm going to tell them .__c0
__s^no__so there's like structure ==__c0
__s^no__right | th- - this - it's not - it's not that this is sort of like semantically ambiguous between these two .__c4
__s__i- - do you kn- - sort of uh that ==__c0
__qy^bu^rt__uhhuh .__c3
__b__it's really about this .__c4
__s__but why would you care about this ?__c4
__s__well it's because you also want to know this or something like that | right .__c4
__s^na__uhhuh .__c3
__s^bk__so it's like you infer the speaker intent .__c0
__s^bk__and then infer a plan a larger plan from that for which you have the additional information .__c0
__fg__yeah .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s.%--__you're just being extra helpful .__c0
__s^bu|qy^d^g__yep .__c3
__s^aa__um ==__c0
__s^aa|s__think - uh well this is just a mental exercise .__c3
__s__yeah .__c0
__s^aa|s__if you think about ==__c3
__s^bk__focus on this question how would you design that .__c3
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c4
__s^bk__is it - do you feel confident about saying this is part of the language already to - to detect those plans ?__c3
__s^bk__and why would anyone care about location ?__c3
__s__if not you know ==__c3
__s^bu__huh .__c4
__s^ba__and so forth .__c3
__s__or do you actually ?==__c3
__s^bk__i mean this is perfectly legitimate .__c3
__s__and i - i would not have any problems with erasing this .__c3
__s__and say that's all we can activate based on the utterance out of context .__c3
__s^df__uhhuh .__c0
__s^2.%--__and just by an additional link .__c0
__%__oh .__c0
__fg|s^nd.%-__what ?__c3
__s.%-__right .__c4
__fg|s.%-__right .__c0
__s^ng__and then the - the - the miracle that we get out the intention go there happens based on what we know about that entity about the user about his various beliefs goals desires blah blah blah .__c3
__s^arp__like ==__c0
__qy^bh^rt__with context and enough user information .__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__s__absolutely fine .__c3
__s^bk__but this is the sort of thing i - i propose that we think about .__c3
__qy.%--__okay .__c0
__fh__so that we actually end up with um - um nodes for the discourse and ontology .__c3
__qy.%--__so that we can put them into our bayes-net .__c3
__s^bu|qy^d^g__never change them .__c3
__%-__so we - all there is is where is x.  .__c3
__s^aa__and eva can play around with the observed things .__c3
__s^nd__and we can run our better javabayes and have it produce some output .__c3
__s__and for the first time in th- - in - in the world we look at our output .__c3
__s^bk__and um - and see uh whether it - it's any good .__c3
__s.%-__okay .__c0
__b__you know ?__c3
__s__i mean ==__c3
__b__here's hoping .__c4
__s^df__huh ?__c3
__s:s__here's hoping | right .__c4
__s^bk__now cross your fingers .__c4
__s^bk__yeah | i - i mean for me this is just a ba- - matter of curiosity .__c3
__s^ng__i want to - would like to look at uh what this ad hoc process of designing a belief net would actually produce .__c3
__s^df__yeah yeah .__c4
__s^na__huh .__c0
__s^aa__if - if we ask it where is something .__c3
__b__and maybe it also h- - enables you to think about certain things more specifically .__c3
__b__um come up with interesting questions to which you can find interesting answers .__c3
__s.%--__and additionally it might fit in really nicely with the paper .__c3
__%-__uhhuh .__c4
__s__because if - if - if we want an example for the paper i suggest there it is .__c3
__s^e__yeah .__c4
__qw__so th- - this might be a nice opening paragraph for the paper as saying you know people look at kinds of - at ambiguities .__c3
__b__and um ==__c3
__s^df.%--__in the literature there's bank .__c3
__s.%--__and whatever kinds of garden path phenomenon .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s:qy^rt__and we can say well that's all nonsense .__c3
__b__a.  uh these things are never really ambiguous in discourse .__c3
__b__b.  don't ever occur really in discourse .__c3
__qrr^rt__but normal statements that seem completely unambiguous such as where is the blah blah actually are terribly complex and completely ambiguous .__c3
__s^am__uhhuh .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__b__and so what every- - everybody else has been doing so far in - in - in - you know has been completely nonsensical and can all go into the wastepaper bin .__c3
__s^am__and the only ==__c3
__s^e__that's always a good way to begin | yeah yeah .__c4
__b__yeah .__c3
__s^ba__and the - the - the only ==__c3
__qh^rt__i am great .__c1
__%--__yeah .__c3
__s^bu__all others are useless .__c4
__qy^d^g^rt__yeah .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__that's good .__c4
__h|s.%--__nice overture .__c3
__qrr__but you know just not really .__c3
__s^no__okay | i'm eja- - exaggerating .__c3
__b__but that might be you know saying hey you know some stuff is - is actually complex if you look at it in - in - in the vacuum .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__and - and ceases to be complex in reality .__c3
__fh|s^e.%--__and some stuff that's as - that's absolutely straightforward in the vacuum is actually terribly complex in reality .__c3
__s^df__would be nice sort of uh also nice um ==bottom up linguistics um type message .__c3
__s^e__uhhuh .__c4
__s^e__true .__c4
__s^e__versus the old top down school .__c3
__s^e__i'm running out of time .__c3
__b__okay .__c3
__s^e__when do you need to start wizarding ?__c1
__s^e__at four ten .__c3
__s^e__okay this is the other bit of news .__c3
__s^e__the subjects today know fey .__c3
__s^e__so she can't be here and do the wizarding .__c3
__s^bk__huh .__c4
__s^ba__so i'm going to do the wizarding .__c3
__s^bk__and thilo's going to do the instructing .__c3
__s^e__huh .__c1
__b__also we're getting a - a person who just got fired uh from her job .__c3
__s^e__uh a person from oakland who is interested in maybe continuing the wizard bit once fey leaves in august .__c3
__s^e__and um she's going to look at it today .__c3
__s^e__which is good news in the sense that if we want to continue after the thir- - thir- - after july we can .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__we could .__c3
__fh__and um ==__c3
__s^bk__and that's also maybe interesting for keith and whoever if you want to get some more stuff into the data collection .__c3
__h__remember this we can completely change the set-up any time we want .__c3
__h__uhhuh .__c4
__s.%--__okay .__c4
__s^bk__look at the results we've gotten so far for the first whatever fifty some subjects .__c3
__fh|s^nd__fifty ?__c0
__s__you've had fifty so far ?__c0
__b__or ?==__c0
__fh__no | we're approaching twenty now .__c3
__s^e__okay .__c0
__s^e.%--__but until fey is leaving we surely will hit the - some of the higher numbers .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c0
__s__huh .__c0
__b__and um ==__c3
__b__so that's cool .__c3
__b__can a- - do more funky stuff .__c3
__s.%--__sure .__c4
__s__yeah | i'll have to look more into that data .__c4
__s^2__is that around ?__c4
__s^aa__like because that's pretty much getting posted or something right away when you get it .__c4
__s^bk__or ?==__c4
__s^df__um ==__c3
__s__i guess it has to be transcribed | huh ?__c4
__b__we have uh uh found someone here who's hand st- - hand transcribing the first twelve .__c3
__b__okay .__c4
__s^df__first dozen subjects .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s^df__just so we can build a - a language model for the recognizer .__c3
__s__okay .__c4
__s^ba__but um - | so those should be available soon .__c3
__s^ba__okay .__c4
__qy^bh__the first twelve .__c3
__s^bk__and ==__c3
__s^ba__i can ch- - ch- - st- - e- ==__c3
__s__you know ==__c4
__s^ba__i mean you know that i - that i looked at the first - the first one and got enough data to keep me going for you know probably most of july .__c4
__s__so but um ==__c4
__s^ba^r__yeah | a- - probably not the right way to do it actually .__c4
__s__but you can listen to ==__c3
__s__a- - y- - y- - y- - you can listen to all of them from your solaris box .__c3
__b__okay .__c4
__fh__if you want .__c3
__fh__right .__c4
__fh|s__it's always fun .__c3
