__s__is it on ?__c5
__s^bk^rt__okay here we go .__c0
__s__uh so - | uh so i c- - i definitely have to leave at three thirty today .__c1
____so ==__c0
__s^bk|s^co__for whatever that's ==__c1
__s__definitely have to go to tea .__c0
__s__so ==__c0
__s__yeah | they're - they're having birthday cake and such .__c1
__s__that too .__c0
__s^bk^rt__but ==__c0
____and so i can't miss that .__c1
__s^bk__you're a may birthday .__c2
__qy^rt__right ?__c2
__s^na|s^aa__i'm a may birthday | yeah .__c1
__s^bk__so i have to ==__c1
__s^m^na__oops !__c3
__fg|s^t__barbara told me .__c2
__fh|s__yeah .__c1
__s__barbara peskin .__c2
__s__um so ==__c0
__s__only a couple of agenda items since no one sent me email for agenda items .__c0
__s:s__uh the first is the i b m transcripts i'd like to uh mention .__c0
__s^e:s__i s- - i spoke with several of you about this .__c0
__s__but just to brainstorm a little bit about what we can do with it .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__ca
__qw__so we got back the i b m transcript and the accuracy looks okay .__c0
__qy^e__there are - i mean there are areas which are clearly wrong .__c0
__s.%-__and there are a lot of areas where they put question marks where the acoustics weren't very good .__c0
__s^bk|s__and i think that's fine putting it in question marks is better than doing it wrong .__c0
__s__the big problem was they had the wrong number of beeps in it .__c0
__s__oops !__c3
__s__so it didn't align .__c0
__s__and that's exactly what i was afraid of .__c0
__s__and i went in and more or less by hand corrected it by loading it ==__c0
__s^df__i wrote a script that will convert it to the multi- - the channeltrans format looked at it in - in channeltrans and found the places where it got a- - unsynchronized .__c0
__s^cs__and then either ==__c0
__b.%__huh ==__ca
__%-__inserted ones .__c3
__fg|s__and in this case only - only had to remove beeps .__c0
__s^bk|s^cs__because that was th- - always the error is that they put in it extraneous beeps .__c0
__fh__huh .__ca
__s^bk__but it's not easy to do .__c0
__s__because the whole thing gets offset .__c0
__fh__and basically it's assigning the wrong speaker to the text and it all gets unaligned .__c0
__qy^rt__so it's very difficult to do .__c0
__s^aa__huh .__ca
__s__so it took me several hours just to do that .__c0
__s__so this is ==__c1
__s__for one meeting .__c3
__s^e__this is one - it's one hour of - of - of speech ?__c1
__s__yep .__c0
__s.%--__and it took you a few hours to - to do it .__c1
__s.%--__it took me a couple hours to write the scripts .__c0
__s__and then it - it probably took me maybe forty five minutes just going through it .__c0
__s__now obviously it will be a lot faster from now on .__c0
__s^ba__because now i sort of understand how it works .__c0
__fh__but i think if we had some way - uh some tool that made it easier to insert and delete beeps it would make it a lot easier .__c0
__s__because one of the problems is that it takes a very long time when you make a change to load it back up in the channel transcriber .__c0
__s^aa|s^ba^r__yep .__c3
__fh__yeah | that's true .__ca
__s^cc^rt__i've noticed that | yeah .__ca
__s^e__one of the things that adam said that i thought would be a good idea would be um if we g- - used different beeps .__c5
__s^cc__and so there may be ==__c0
__%-__which makes sense .__ca
__qh^cs__so for example if we alternated between two beeps a high and a low .__c5
__fh__he said that ?__c1
__qy__th- ==__c5
__s__uh well in - in some email that uh we had .__c5
__s__oh on the email .__ca
__b__for ==__c3
__b__oh oh okay .__c1
__s__yeah .__ca
__s__i didn't just say that | no .__c0
__fh__yeah | um - because then ==__c5
__b.%__so th- - so this is the o- - the other approach which is what do we do in the future to try to make this less common ?__c0
__qy__yeah .__c5
__s^aa__but it's still going to happen .__c0
__s.%--__well and then the other possibility was - e- - that we provide them with a - a file that already has the beeps in it or something .__ca
__fh__so ==__c0
__s.%--__huh .__c1
__fh__wasn't that what you said ?__ca
__s:s__sort of a text template .__c5
__s^f__but i don't know how we can do that .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__ca
__s__yeah | we don't know what their process is .__c0
__b__so i had two ideas .__c0
__s__the first was to provide them a text template that had both the beeps in it and the speaker i ds .__c0
__fh|s:s__yeah .__ca
__b__you know just male female english nonenglish one two three four .__c0
__s:s__um ==__c0
__fh__can i - i - i just ?==__c1
__s^bk|s^ba__and they just filled it in .__c0
__%--__how- - how many - how many beeps are there and how many do we- - were they d- - were - were off ?__c1
__s.%--__it was like a hundred twenty .__c0
__fh__and they had a hundred twenty three or something like that .__c0
__s:s__all right .__c1
__s__is that right ?__c0
__s:s__well l- - i- - i thought it was a lot more than that .__c5
__b__and is it a ?==__c1
__s__well i - i don't remember .__c0
__s__they were three off basically .__c5
__s.%--__yeah | and it was a hundred ish .__c1
__fh__and this is the mixed signal ?__c2
__s__oh !__ca
__s^cs__so - so if you get one ==__c1
__b.%__huh .__ca
__b.%__uh uh excuse me .__c1
__s^bk__if you get one off it - t- - everything is off because of the alignment .__c1
__s^t^tc__right ?__c1
__s__yep .__c0
__s__yep .__c3
__s__uh and this is all in one file that's continuous .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c5
__s__yep .__c0
__fh__so why don't you make it multiple files ?__c1
__qy^rt^t^tc__how would that help ?__c0
__s^aa__because then if they have one off then - then it would only screw up that file .__c1
__s__oh | you mean just break the one hour into a few chunks .__c0
__fh__yeah .__c1
__s__i mean it seems now if you just ha- - make one mistake then everything is off .__c1
__s__well the only - the only question about that that i have is um i think brian has to put all this stuff onto a tape .__c5
__fh__so i don't know whether ==__c5
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^bu^rt__i'm sure they would prefer it sort of one hour .__c0
__s^bk__can he send them - i guess he could send them multiple tapes .__c5
__s__oh .__ca
__s__uh ==__c5
__s^2^ba__yeah | just say okay is ten minutes is ==__c1
__s__i mean maybe there's other things to do that are more clever .__c1
__%-__but this just seemed to be the sort of the obvious thing .__c1
__s__because again if you make one mistake then everything after that mistake is off .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__b__and uh ==__c1
__s^bk__well the only other issue is we'd have to worry about reassembling them in the proper order .__c5
__fh__uh ==__c5
__qw__yeah .__c1
__qy^e__that - i mean just naming schemes will get ==__c0
__s.%-__we can definitely do that .__c0
__s__so t- - so one question is are there good places in the files where we can really do that ?__c0
__s^aa|s__well the other thing - you can ==__c2
__qrr__i mean so - so - so someone will have to go through them and listen to them and pick a place to break them .__c0
__qy^d^f^g__yeah .__c3
__s:s__the other thing you can do ==__c2
__b__this is on the mixed signal ?__c2
__b__or are these the individual ?==__c2
__s__the ones with the beeps that they're getting that they made mistakes on is the mixed one ?__c2
__b__they are played from the individual .__c0
__s__individual channels .__c5
__b.%__individual channels .__c3
__s__or they're indivi- ==__c2
__b__if it's individual um y- - c- - we can probably run a forced alignment .__c2
__s__where you c- - include the beeps as words and pretty much figure out where the errors are .__c2
__s^ba__i don't think we could do it on the mixed signal .__c2
__s^e^rt__because it ==__c2
__s^bk__but on the individual channels that would probably work if they have enough words in the transcript .__c2
__b.%__yeah | we - in fact that's - yeah maybe we ==__c5
__s:s__so i mean that's pretty quick to run .__c2
__s^2__it - it's um ==__c2
__s__i mean we could try it .__c2
__s^bk__because if a beep is treated as a unique word ==__c2
__s^bu|qy^d^g^rt__you mean so actually put - put the wavefile in with beep in it .__c0
__s^aap__beep ==__c2
__s__put in - put beep in as a word .__c2
__s^bk__and pu- - and have a beep model .__c0
__s__we have the original wavefile with all the beeps .__c5
__s__yeah yeah | well the beep model - actually you could train a beep model .__c2
__s^aa__that - that's a good idea .__c2
__qy^rt__it would be very good .__c5
__fh__um ==__c2
__%-__yes | it would be because it's very very regular .__c0
__s^aa|s^na__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__yeah | so um ==__c2
__s__oh kind of low variance .__c1
__s^bk__wouldn't that be ?__c1
__b__yeah .__c3
__s:qw__yeah very low .__c5
__fh__yeah .__c0
__s^ba.%-__you sort of might end up with some infinities there .__c1
__s^co__um that might actually ==__c2
__s^df:qw__you have to - may - add some jitter to it .__c0
__s^ar|%-__but ==__c1
__s^e:s__can i see that ?__c1
__%--__i mean that might actually work .__c2
__s^bk__where's the case ?__c1
__s:qy__because you'll i guess the trick is figuring out you know where it doesn't align .__c2
__s^bk|s__but if it's a problem of extra beeps rather than missing beeps then um that's easier .__c2
__%-__it could t- - it could there could be some missing ones .__c5
__s.%-__and it might work .__c2
__s__oh .__c2
__s^bu__but ==__c5
__s.%--__so is this a ==__c1
__qy^rt__it's just in this case they were not .__c0
__s^ar__seven or something ?__c1
__s^ar__or ?==__c1
__s^bk|s.%--__what is it ?__c1
__s.%-__m one hundred .__ca
__qy^bu^d__so i think - uh chuck had a good explanation for it which i liked .__c0
__s^e^rt__m one hundred oh .__c1
__s^aa|s.%-__which is these - they're listening to it and so they write something down and let's say they miss it they rewind .__c0
__s^bk__well they hear the beep again .__c0
__s__was that that beep or was that a different beep ?__c0
__s.%-__oh yeah .__c2
__b__so that's why chuck was suggesting different tones .__c0
__fh__my original thought was you could have a different tone for each speaker .__c0
__b.%__you know there's plenty of tone space .__c0
__s^ba^fe__and that might help cue the transcriptionist .__c0
__s__you know give them a little cue about where they are .__c0
__b.%__or you could - you could have ascending tones or something .__c1
__s__what do you mean ?__c0
__fg__uh | or ==__c1
__qw__yeah .__c2
__s:qw__increasingly high - higher frequencies .__c5
__s^2:s__you could have um each speaker in the meeting say beep and record it .__c2
__s^m__and that will be their pro- ==__c2
__b__no i just - thi- - i don't know if you have a hundred or something just - just sort of move them up i- - mu- - up a - a half tone or something for - for each one .__c1
__s^e^rt__sorry .__c2
__s__and then ==__c1
__s^e__that's what i was saying is that - that you could have - each speaker could have their own tone .__c0
__s:qw__oh | was it ?__c1
__qy^rt__oh .__c1
__qy^rt__see i should listen .__c1
__h|s__yeah ?__c1
__s^bk__huh ==__c2
__qy^t1__and you know since there are no more than you know ten speakers or so per meeting there's plenty of tone space .__c0
__fg|s^ba^t__oh .__ca
__s__well ==__ca
__fh__but ==__ca
__b__uh okay | yeah so the only ==__c1
__s__that might work too .__c1
__%--__yeah | i was just thinking that actually temporally just uh uh uh an increasing tones so that ==__c1
__fh__oh okay .__c0
__s__they would really have a sense of whether they were going you know forward or backward .__c1
__fg__bo eep be oop !__c0
__fh|s^rt__in the end ?__c3
__s^rt__yeah .__c3
__b__well you th- ==__ca
__b__or ==__c1
__fh__so just r- - r- - truly chron- - chromatically up all the way through the entire meeting .__ca
__s^fa__yeah .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c1
__s^bu|qy^d^f^g__well it's a thought .__c1
__s^aa|s__interesting .__ca
__s__oh oh th- - oh i see .__c0
__s__it'd be impossible to r- - to misorder them .__ca
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__ca
__s__but yo- - i guess you'd still get the mistake that you mentioned .__c2
__fh__because the person ==__c2
__s__well ==__c0
__s:s__i mean if that's some of the errors those would probably stay the same regardless .__c2
__s:s__yep .__c0
__s^rt:s__i mean chuck's suggestion of just two beeps is nice .__c0
__s:s__yeah maybe .__c1
__b__because then you could have them actually transcribe h beep or l beep .__c0
__s:s__high beep or low beep .__c0
__s^e__and then when we get them back if we see two l beeps in a row ==__c5
__b.%__it would be much easier .__c0
__fh__that's probably better .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah | you have like a sanity - sanity check on them .__c2
__%-__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__s- - scratch my other idea .__c1
__s^bk__it's pretty simple .__ca
__s__pretty simple .__ca
__s__that's a good idea .__c2
__%--__yeah .__c1
__s.%--__yep .__c0
__b.%__alternating .__c2
__s:s__yeah .__c1
__s:s__and it would - it seems like it would help them .__c5
__s__you know if they just finished a long passage and they heard one beep and then they hear it again they know it's the same beep .__c5
__s^bu^rt:s__versus if they heard a slightly different one .__c5
__%-__yeah .__c1
__s^e__huh interesting .__ca
__b__yeah | that's a good like error checking approach i think .__c2
__s^e__yeah | we can ==__c0
__qy^rt__yeah | like do - do uh one for each ca- - one for each person in the meeting you can only hire people who have perfect pitch .__c0
__s__and they can say a flat b .__c0
__s^e__well well .__ca
__s^bk__high low is pretty straightforward .__ca
__s^rt:s__great idea .__c1
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__ca
__s__no | two is probably better than what i was suggesting .__c1
__s__because what i was suggesting in order to make it through a reasonable range for the whole thing you'd have to have the - the tonal differences between the two kind of small .__c1
__s^e__and actually you want them large .__c1
__s^aa__yep .__c0
__s.%--__so ==__c1
__s^df__you'd have to - they'd have to have the acoustics of dogs t- - hear into the high high ranges .__ca
__s^df^no__uhhuh .__c0
__s:s__yeah .__c1
__s^bk|s:s__so i think certainly doing two beeps is - is no brainer .__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__ca
__s.%-__and then the other question is if they can ==__c0
__s^bk__if they do something on a computer in a format we can handle we could give them a text file that was a template with speaker i d and beeps already in it .__c0
__s:s__and then they could just fill that in .__c0
__s^bk|s__yeah .__c5
__s^bk__maybe i should write to brian and tell him what the problem was .__c5
__s|s^f__so what ==__c1
__qw__and what our proposed solutions are .__c5
__s^df.%-__right .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__c1
__s__see what he thinks would work best with them .__c5
__s__i mean what's going wrong on the other end ?__c1
__b__what are they doing ?__c1
__s^bk__well as i said i think - we don't actually know .__c0
__s__what uh ?==__c1
__s^bk__but i think chuck's hypothesis was a good one .__c0
__s^bk__which is you re- - r- - you listen to something you write down what you thought you heard but you want to listen to it again so you r- - rewind .__c0
__s__and there are some ==__c5
__s|s^bk__and then you hear the beep again and then you say well is that that beep .__c0
__b__or is that a new beep .__c0
__s^bk^rt__i don't remember .__c0
__s__and so you know a couple times they got it wrong .__c0
__s^df__and there are some cases where there's um very little speech before you hear a beep .__c5
__s^bsc__so you hear a little bit of speech beep .__c5
__s__yeah .__c3
__s.%--__uhhuh .__ca
__b__a little bit of speech beep .__c5
__b__maybe three of those in a row .__c5
__s__and was that three beeps ?__c5
__s^aa__was that two beeps ?__c5
__b__um - see they have th- - brian said the setup that they have is um ==__c5
__s^ba__uh - i- - um ==__c5
__s^aa|s^na__they've got headphones .__c5
__%-__and then i guess they have a computer .__c5
__fg|s^tc__and they have a foot pedal .__c5
__s__which lets them quickly scan back and forth through the tape .__c5
__s.%--__i- - i- - t- - i- - s- ==__c5
__b__makes the tape go real fast forward or fast backward .__c5
__s__and so they can hear something then step on the pedal and quickly rewind and go back and hear it again .__c5
__s^bk__and so they're ==__c5
__s__i think they're probably going over and over f- - sections .__c5
__b.%__and then they get confused about whether they've already put that beep .__c5
__s^tc__or if they heard you know three beeps in a row was that three or two ?__c5
__s.%-__and ==__c5
__s^aa__it's a shame we can't really give a number .__ca
__%-__okay .__c1
__s^ba__s- ==__c1
__s__so it would be a number and a beep .__ca
__%-__e- ==__ca
__s^aa__it's a shame we can't do that .__ca
__fh__well we could .__c0
__%-__oh that's an interesting idea .__c5
__b__we could but then that starts getting pretty long .__c0
__s__no no no but wait maybe - maybe what we have instead of a beep is a uh synthesized number .__c5
__fg|qw.%--__yep .__c3
__s|s^f__and they put the number in when they hear it .__c5
__qy^rt__that'll work .__ca
__qy^rt__so inst- - replacing the beep with twenty three ==__c5
__s^aa|s__twenty four ==__c5
__s.%--__twenty five ==__c5
__fh__and then they have to transcribe what that number is each time .__c5
__s^rt__wow | that'd also be shorter to type .__ca
__s.%--__yeah | just a two three two four that would be ==__c5
__fh__well they would have to have a mark .__c0
__qy^t1__there'd be some kind of mark in front of it .__c5
__s^rt^t1__interesting .__ca
__s__well because they're s- - distinguishing between twenty three ==__c1
__s__that's your indicator there and twenty three that somebody happens to say in a meeting .__c1
__fh__oh that's true .__ca
__qw.%--__well it would have t- - yeah it would have to be um you know either obviously a s- - sounding synthesized uh little ==__c5
__qw__yeah .__c3
__s__but they might miss that .__c1
__s^bk__right ?__c1
__s^t1__or maybe could it be a click and the number .__ca
__s__yeah .__c5
__s^bu.%--__or a beep and the number .__c5
__s^aa__well it's sequential .__c0
__s^aa|qw__or a beep and the number and then - and then you just do the - the num- - th- - you do it as a d- - a digit .__ca
__s^bk__right | you would go sequential so unless you got pretty unlucky ==__c0
__s^ar^t1__uh right .__c5
__s^aa|s^na__yeah .__c3
__fh__what the person was saying and the number ==__c0
__s__in fact we could put it at the beginning of each utterance .__c5
__s__we could say beep one .__c5
__s.%--:s__and then they'll hear the speech .__c5
__s__i think having a beep too is good .__c1
__fh__so beep number ==__c0
__s:s__yeah the- ==__c0
__b__or a number beep ==__c5
__qy^bu^cs^d^rt__it's just getting pretty long .__c0
__s^aa|s^na__you know the utterances are very short .__c0
__s^bk__yep .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__s^bu^rt:s__and so you're going to be talking beep number yes beep number no .__c0
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c5
__s__well if - if it saves time ==__ca
__s^aa__yeah | and u- - i think it would - i - actually i thi- - i like that .__c5
__s^cc__yeah .__ca
__s.%--__and when they transcribe this meeting it's going to be really impossible .__c0
__s|qy^d^f^g__i think it would ==__c5
__qw^br__yeah | that's funny .__c3
__s^aa__w- - we're saying beep yeah - for instance .__c1
__fh__yeah yep .__c0
__s.%--:s__yeah .__c5
__s^rt__but see that would - that would definitely keep ==__c5
__s^bu__it's not a bad idea .__c0
__s__yeah .__c5
__%--__keep things from getting out of sequence .__c5
__%--__if they heard it over again they would know it would be obvious from their transcript whether they did that one or not .__c5
__fg|s__it might actually help them in terms of their place holding .__ca
__b__that would help get them synchronized .__c0
__s^df.%--__yeah .__ca
__s__and it might be helpful to them in terms of d- - act- ==__ca
__b__yeah .__c5
__s:s__i think it would be .__c0
__s^aa__because they would know their place .__c0
__s__and we have plenty of digits data .__c5
__s.%-__so ==__c5
__%-__yeah .__c0
__s^bk|s^bu__they would know their place darn it !__c0
__s__we- ==__c5
__s^na__know ==__ca
__%-__those transcriptionists need to know their place .__c0
__s__oh .__c3
__s^bk__well no no no no .__ca
__%-__but it sounds like a k- - a - a - a short conversation with brian might be - might be helpful to get a sense of what's going on .__c1
__s.%--__yeah | i'll - i'll - i'll write him an ==__c5
__s:s__yeah | the numbers are a good idea .__c0
__s__yeah .__c5
__b__okay .__ca
__s:s__or just ==__c3
__s^bk|s^bu.%--__othe- - other than lengthening the transcript i think it would be very helpful .__c0
__qy.%--__just instead of the sequential number for- ==__c3
__s^co__perhaps just the speaker i d or something .__c3
__%-__just say speaker one or spea- ==__c3
__s^df__or just one two three four for four speakers or something .__c3
__s^aa__pppt .__c3
__s^bk__could - could be helpful .__c3
__s^no__i - i- ==__ca
__%-__yeah | you don't have to ==__c0
__s.%-__you could keep them short by not s- - or just go one through ten one through ten one through ten or one through twenty .__c0
__s.%--__yeah yeah yeah yep .__c3
__s__and then also if we - i mean i don't know what their setup is but your template idea might be a way of - of - of ==__ca
__s:s__uhhuh .__c0
__s__we could actually build the numbers into a template .__ca
__b__yep .__c0
__s^bk__well ==__ca
__s:s__i'll talk to brian and see what he ==__c5
__s:s__yeah | single digit numbers ==__c0
__s^rt__that also appeals to me so that you don't have to you know ==__c0
__b.%__yeah .__c3
__b__that's a good idea .__ca
__s:s__very simple .__ca
__s__one hundred twenty four .__c0
__b__yeah .__c5
__s^bu__yeah .__c3
__qw^df__well th- - although ==__c1
__fh__beep one thousand three hundred forty two .__c0
__s^bk__you're saying i- - it's - it's about an hour meeting .__c1
__s.%-__uhhuh .__c0
__s__and there were a hundred and twenty three ==__c1
__%-__i don't remember .__c0
__s^aa__it's forty five minutes .__ca
__s^aa__chuck was saying there was more than that .__c0
__s^bk__huh ?__c1
__s^ba__forty five minutes for that one .__ca
__s^e__more beeps than that .__c0
__b__i was thinking there was on the order of fifteen hundred segments .__c5
__s^bk__but maybe i'm ==__c5
__b__there must be .__c2
__s^j__because otherwise you're going a whole ==__c2
__s^nd__i think it should be more .__c3
__s.%-__it's possible .__ca
__fg|%--__yeah .__c3
__%-__that was at least forty five minutes .__c2
__s^ba__right ?__c2
__s__yeah that's right .__ca
__s^bk__was it that many ?__c0
__fh__i just don't recall .__c0
__s^bu|qy^d^g__yeah | it was forty five minutes .__ca
__%-__that's the shortest meeting we have .__c2
__s__most of them are double that or ==__c2
__b__yep .__c0
__s.%--__well i was just wondering what the average length thing was .__c1
__s__so ==__c2
__s^fa__oh | of a - of a segment that they're hearing ?__c5
__%--__it's ==__c3
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__i don't know .__c5
__s|s^ba__huh interesting .__ca
__s__easy enough to figure out .__c0
__s__uh ==__c1
__s__i don't know .__c5
__s:s__so if there are in the in the hundreds and thou- - or thousands of these ==__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c5
__qw__we have all that data .__c0
__s__it must be in the high hundreds of them at least .__c2
__s^m|s^aa__so right so | i- ==__c1
__s^cs:s^am__so that's getting a little cumbersome for them to type like five hundred .__c2
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__b__well with just one digit though .__ca
__s__i think ==__ca
__fh__but yeah | if they recycle through ==__c2
__s__well ==__c1
__s^bu__yeah | if we - if we did mod ten then ==__c5
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__right | but my point was you know if - it's a big difference to me if there's a thousand or there's a hundred .__c1
__s^aa|s__if there's a thousand then that means that this is only happening three times out of a thousand .__c1
__s^bk__which means you know even just splitting it up into a few files would probably take - you know nearly all the time .__c1
__s^bk__there would be no ==__c1
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__s__w- - if it's a hundred then - you know that's not the issue .__c1
__s__but if it's a hundred then the average length of each one is pretty - pretty long .__c1
__s__and so having a little thing at the front of it is no big deal .__c1
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c5
__fh|s__so that's why i was curious .__c1
__b__yeah | you're right .__c0
__fh__it had to have been more than that .__c0
__%-__i mean it was a forty five minute meeting .__c0
__s^na.x__so ==__c0
__s^aa|s^na__right .__c2
__s^t^tc__and it certainly was not a minute a chunk .__c0
__s^bk__it was a few seconds a chunk .__c0
__s^tc__that's what i ==__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__yeah | so it'd be a lot of overhead to type .__c2
__s.%--__so i'm just mis remembering .__c0
__fh__i'm just mis remembering .__c0
__s^bk__oh i ==__c2
__s^ba__so ==__c0
__s__well | and the other thing is maybe the numbers would help them keep their place in the transcript and speed the process ==__ca
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^rt__it might make the transcript faster .__c0
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__w- - wel- - i mean i - a quick conversation with brian would be good .__c0
__s^rt__uhhuh .__ca
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__so ==__c0
__fh__okay .__c0
__s^ba__and other than that ==__c0
__s^rt__actually if it is ==__c2
__s^rt__u- ==__c2
__s__i mean it's not a bad idea to try the alignment .__c2
__s__um if there's only like three of them then if you align the first point at which things get messed up is sort of the location of the first problem .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__s__and then the second p- ==__c2
__fh__i mean you could do it that way .__c2
__s.%--__or you could ==__c2
__s.%--__it's - it's ==__c2
__s__it would be able to handle any errors .__c2
__%--__so if they make on the average that many and it costs them more time to do something different than what they're doing which i don't know but if it does then we could try doing that as a post process .__c2
__s__right .__c0
__s.%-__and um have a student or a transcriber run this alignment .__c2
__%--__or we can do it .__c2
__s^bu__yep .__c0
__s^aa__and ==__c2
__s^na__you know actually what - all that we would ==__c5
__s^bu__then you can iteratively figure out where the problems are .__c2
__s^aa__you know liz all we would re- ==__c5
__s^bu|qy^d^g__it would take a little work .__c2
__s^aa|s^na__but not any real human - not a lot of human work .__c2
__s^ba__right | i mean that's what we want to avoid .__c0
__s.%--__i mean if - in terms of the alignment actually all we would need is - we wouldn't even need words .__c5
__s__we would need a general speech model and a beep model .__c5
__s^aa__because all we're really concerned about is missing beeps or too many beeps .__c5
__s__well the for- - the forced alignment will run fa- ==__c2
__s^aa__so if we had a ==__c5
__s^ba__otherwise it'll take forever .__c2
__fg__i mean to really run recognition ==__c2
__fh__uhhuh .__c5
__s__well - | l- - i guess what i'm thinking of is that w- - that a lot of times there will be - they'll put in question marks that represent some unknown amount of speech .__c5
__s^rt__or ==__c2
__s__right .__c2
__s:s__so we're going to have to have some kind of ==__c5
__s^rt__yeah | then we just map it to a reject model .__c2
__s__in - and in fact that's what we do now .__c2
__s__because there's cases even after jane listens where you know we have ==__c2
__s__right .__c5
__s__h- ==__c5
__s__an expert can't even tell what they're talking about .__c2
__s__yeah .__c5
__s^rt:s^rt__um so that's okay .__c2
__fh__just map that to reject .__c2
__fh|s.%--__right | well what i was thinking is map all the speech to the reject model .__c5
__s^e__and ==__c2
__s__and then you have a beep model .__c5
__qh__yeah .__c1
__qh__but that won't work .__c0
__s__yeah | you're still talking a forced al- ==__c1
__s__because it's ==__c0
__s.x__the forced alignment might not work then .__c2
__b__although we can try it .__c2
__%__um ==__c2
__fh__well but | all we'll get ==__c0
__fg|s^ba__well with the beep models is what's really - you'd have really g- - it would be really good though .__c1
__s.%--__the beep model is - is going to match like really well .__c5
__fh__right .__c2
__s^df__so ==__c1
__s^df^e__so it's p- - so it's really just doing yeah a keyword like a spotting for beep with ==__c1
__s^cs__right | but it'll - it'll grab the next beep in other words .__c2
__s^cs__it'll be ==__c2
__qy^d^f^g__you'll get back another offset .__c2
__s^cs^e__um - | i mean i was thinking of .__c2
__b__then i - and then i realized well the recognizer will just go along and line up all the beeps .__c2
__fh__and then there'll be all the extra beeps at the end .__c2
__qy__if there were more beeps then you wanted .__c2
__s^bd__right | you - you need - but you need the text .__c0
__s^cs^df.%--__so you need the word - you need the word to c- - sort of control the relative location .__c2
__s__to tell it where it got it wrong .__c0
__s^am__yeah .__c0
__s^f__no i'm not sug- - i'm not suggesting that we don't have anything between the beeps .__c5
__s__it will tell you ==__c2
__s:s__oh .__c2
__s:s__but i - what i'm saying is what's between the beeps we don't really care about .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__i think you do care about it .__c2
__s.%--:s.%--__because you have to know which ones match which .__c0
__qy^d^f^g__unless you want to know if they're ==__c2
__s__right .__c2
__b__otherwise you just count up the total number of beeps .__c2
__s__and we can do that with wordcount .__c0
__%--__right we already know that - that we're three short .__c0
__s^bd^no__yeah .__c2
__qy^rt__and so if we just did spee- - uh beep and non beep all you would get is that you have three mistakes .__c0
__qrr.%--__but you wouldn't tell you which ones were wrong .__c0
__s^aa|s.%--__right .__c2
__s:s__you need some of the words in there so that you can say well this segment matches this one .__c0
__s__this segment matches this one .__c0
__b__and this one doesn't match at all .__c0
__%--__unless we insert a beep .__c0
__s__i mean the only thing i'm worried about with that approach is that if we need to figure out the beep alignment problem before the transcribers do the corrections here then we're in trouble .__c2
__s__okay .__c1
__s^aa__in other words if the transcripts aren't sort of good enough that the aligner constraints are good enough to sort of show you where the errors are then it wouldn't work .__c2
__b__but it might work .__c2
__s^na__it might work to do this if their transcripts are pretty close on the words that usually get recognized correctly .__c2
__fg__which are the you know function words .__c2
__fg__the common words .__c2
__s__well actually you know there's an even easier way .__c0
__s__we don't really need a beep model .__c0
__s^f|qh__um just extract the segments and do a forced alignment .__c0
__qh__and if the score is good then you say it matches .__c0
__qw__right | you can also ==__c2
__b__in fact that's what we do ==__c2
__s^bk__right | the individual segments between the beeps ==__c2
__s^bk__um if beeps were like the segments that we get from um the transcription tool already that that's what we have done .__c2
__s__and it works very well .__c2
__b__you can see these segments align and these don't .__c2
__s__um then you just have to go back in and figure out where the endpoints of those segments are .__c2
__s^e__because some of them will be wrong .__c2
__s^bk__because the bi- - the beeps were missing by definition .__c2
__s__right .__c0
__s^e__so do you get a score for each alignment ?__c5
__s^2__so it might actually work .__c2
__%--__is that what you get ?__c5
__%--__um you ca- - you get um ==__c2
__s^aa__definitely when they don't align at all it - it - it fails .__c2
__s^df__i mean that - that's how we found a lot of problems before with um words being on the wrong place or something .__c2
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c5
__fh__so a failed alignment is a very good indicator that - that the words don't match up .__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c5
__s^cs__i'm just wondering when - wha- - what it means to fail .__c5
__s^bk__um ==__c2
__fh__is it the - the likelihood scores below some threshold ?==__c5
__%--__yeah is uh - it - right .__c2
__fh|qh^cs__it can't match up the ==__c2
__s__that's why you actually need the text .__c2
__s^bk__in order to force you to try to match something that gives you a model to match against .__c2
__s__so ==__c2
__s__it's just an idea if - if it turns out that ==__c2
__fh__i mean i also like this idea of high and low beeps or ==__c2
__s__but it - if suppose we get one or two errors still per you know per transcript then we z- - we might want to try some approach like that .__c2
__s^aa__well the numbered ones would make it a lot easier .__c0
__s^bk__because you could then really localize where the error is .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__ca
__b__yeah .__ca
__s^bu.%--__where it is .__c2
__b.%__right .__c2
__s^bk__if - so if that doesn't add time for them that'd be great .__c2
__s__yeah .__ca
__s^no__yep .__c0
__s^bk__you know like ==__c2
__s.%--__i think it would save them time .__ca
__s^df.%--__we have to ask them .__c2
__s^bk__i think it would help them keep the track - track of it .__ca
__s.%--__uh - | uh again especially if there's hundred - many hundreds or thousands i still think it would - it would cut the incidence of this a lot if it was possible to break it into a couple files .__c1
__s__interesting .__ca
__s__yeah because it you know it's r- - r- ==__c1
__b__yeah .__ca
__s^aa__i guess also even for the transcribers it's quicker to load a smaller file .__c2
__s^e__into the - you know t- - for the checking problem .__c2
__qy__yeah | i mean we could certainly break the meetings .__c0
__s^ar__we could certainly break the meetings into pi- - pieces .__c0
__s.%--__into twenty minutes chunks or something .__c2
__s^bk__or ==__c2
__fh|s__so just ==__c0
__s__i mean you've already broken them into chunks .__c1
__s^bk__so if you have - if you have a th- - if you have a thousand chunks then make ten things of a hundred or - or you know .__c1
__s__just ==__c5
__qy^d^f^g__just accumulate it till you get twenty minutes worth ?__c5
__s__there's one file .__c5
__s__that's true | yeah .__c0
__%--__yep .__c3
__s__and then it will be you know this - eve- - every now and then there'll be a - a beep missing .__c1
__s^e__so someone's going to talk to brian .__ca
__b__yeah | i'll ==__c5
__s^cs__i think that was chuck .__c0
__s^e__i'll talk to him .__c5
__s__okay .__ca
__s__yep .__c0
__fh__i also looked thr- - over the text .__ca
__s.%--__and i was impressed by the accuracy .__ca
__s.%--__it looks really good .__ca
__fh__yeah | it does look good .__c0
__s^ba^cs__i mean i found several errors .__c0
__s^bk__but they were not significant .__c0
__s__they were all things that i could easily listen to and sometimes convince myself they said one thing and sometimes the other .__c0
__b__so ==__c0
__qh^e__yeah | it's there .__ca
__s__uhhuh .__ca
__s__i haven't looked at these .__c2
__qh__um ==__c2
__b__because i was gone last week .__c2
__s__but - but don had told me that there's a difference in some of the conventions .__c2
__s__oh yes | but this is not important .__ca
__s__so - but those are all easy things .__c2
__s__it's systematic .__ca
__b__right ?__c2
__%--__yeah .__ca
__s__yeah okay .__c2
__b__and - and brian actually forwarded me in advance .__ca
__s__he - he wor- - he very nicely worked out a set of conventions which is intermediate between ours and the ones that they're used to .__ca
__b__which is - which is really a good - a good way to do it .__ca
__s__okay .__c2
__b__so we can just map .__c2
__s__map them to ==__c2
__s^e__no problem .__ca
__s^na__great .__c2
__b__huh ==__c2
__b__okay .__c0
__s__um ==__c0
__b__we still haven't really sat down and talked about file reorganization .__c0
__s^bk__and directory reorganization .__c0
__s__so we still have to do that .__c0
__b__but i don't think we need to do that in this meeting .__c0
__b__but uh it is something that needs to get done .__c0
__s__and i want to also coordinate it with dave so that we do a level zero backup right after .__c0
__b__so we don't waste a lot of tapes .__c0
__s__but uh ==__c0
__s__so - let's - let's try to do that sometime .__c0
__s__okay ?__c0
__s^rt__ch- - okay ?__c0
__s__yeah | we can do it this week .__ca
__s__yeah .__ca
__s^df__um ==__c0
__s__we also still have to make a decision about mike issues .__c0
__s__what we want to do with that .__c0
__qy__i thought we were going to get two more of the ones ==__ca
__s^df^e__and just swap them in and out ?__c0
__s:qw__yeah | we could certainly do that .__c0
__s__so why not ?__c3
__s__so uh morgan just to ==__c0
__s:qw__uh since you weren't at the meeting last week uh apparently a bunch of the e d u fe- - folks really hate this style mike .__c0
__s^bsc__um | i wouldn't - well it they didn't say hate .__c2
__b__but they they c- - they come on time to their meetings in order to not be left the last person who has to sit by those mikes .__c2
__s.%-__can i - i c- - i ==__ca
__b.%__i mean that's - that's - that's a fairly strong indication of dislike .__c0
__s__i actually really like them though .__ca
__%-__um ==__c0
__s^bu__which one is these ?__c1
__%-__there were a few people - you and like three or four people who really like them .__c2
__s^aa__the uh ==__c1
__qr.%-__the crown .__c0
__s^aa|s^ba__uhhuh .__c1
__s^aa__yeah | i do .__ca
__s^bk__and e- - and th- - all the others really don't .__c2
__s^bk__so what i was thinking is we could get a few more of the sony ones .__c0
__b__and just unplug them and plug them in .__c0
__s.%--__and the only thing is that when you fill out the digit forms you have to be sure to indicate which mike was actually used .__c0
__s__so i mean that's easy to do .__c0
__b__um ==__c0
__s^bk__it - it moves us away from this uniform all the mikes are the same .__c0
__s:qw__which some people had said was a benefit .__c0
__%-__but ==__c0
__s^bk__the other thing too is th- - y- - you said that the acoustic pra- - q- - quality of the one that you're wearing the fancy one is actually somewhat better than ==__ca
__s^bk__it is | yeah .__c0
__s__so i- - i don't know if it's a noticeable difference .__ca
__s.%--__but it is ==__ca
__s:s^fe__i mean i p- - i personally really prefer that model .__ca
__s__so i think you know we've got this problem of people having different different preferences .__ca
__s__you know there are so many things about this that are non uniform that i think having having some modicum of uniformity is a good thing .__c1
__s__but you're just not going to - i mean we've ==__c1
__s__okay .__ca
__s__uh ==__c1
__s__for instance jus- - just the fact that people sit in different positions different times .__c1
__s__the - exactly where they put it with respect to their mouth is different each time .__c1
__%--__yep .__c0
__s__uh ==__c1
__s.%--__i - i just don't ==__c1
__s__i mean i think we - we're - we're getting rid of major differences .__c1
__s^e__uhhuh .__ca
__s__like we're not using the lapel anymore an- - and so forth .__c1
__b__but ==__c1
__qy^rt__the other stuff is just going to - some variability we're going to have to accept .__c1
__s.%--__it's - i - i understand .__ca
__s^aa__that's fine with me .__ca
__s.%--__i - i g- - would say that um i find this model easier to adjust .__ca
__s^aa|%-__that's one of the reasons i don't like these .__ca
__s^cs__because i keep m- - you know bending it .__ca
__b__uhhuh .__c1
__fh__and then it's n- - and i never really know ==__ca
__s^bd^no__yeah | see i - i happen to like the old one better .__c1
__qy^rt__you do ?__ca
__s^aa__but ==__c1
__%__okay .__ca
__s__yeah .__c1
__qh__what about just a different headband thing ?__c2
__s^no__and some people do .__c1
__s^bk__but ==__c1
__s^cs__or even if we could attach two headband ==__c2
__s^f__i mean ==__c0
__s:qw__th- ==__c0
__%-__like i don't mind those .__c2
__s^bk__we abs- - th- ==__c0
__s^aa|s^cs:qw__but it they bounce around .__c2
__b__we have lots o- - of choices of microphones .__c0
__s.%--:qw.%--__i mean can we keep the microphones and just somehow attach a more comfortable thing over your head ?__c2
__b__uhhuh .__c0
__s__huh ==__c0
__s.%--__yeah .__c0
__b__that's my problem with this one .__c2
__s__the - the ear thing comes out to here .__c2
__fh__it doesn't even fit over my ear .__c2
__s__right .__c0
__qy^d^f^g__and for some of the others it's - their ears were shaped in a way that didn't hold the ==__c2
__s.%--__huh ==__ca
__%--__right .__c0
__s__huh ==__ca
__s:s__i mean so we can go microphone shopping and get - get more microphones .__c0
__fh__it's just - w- ==__c0
__b.%__then they have to be rewired though .__ca
__b__i'm just not sure what we should do .__c0
__s.%-__yeah .__c3
__s^bk|s__don't they ?__ca
__s__specially .__ca
__s__you know | i mean here's another argument against worrying too much about uniformity .__c1
__s__we have something like forty five hours of data collected .__c1
__b__and uh we're also going to be integrating in this corpus stuff that's - that's being done at u w uh with entirely different microphones .__c1
__s__yep .__c0
__s.%-__so i - i think you know getting away from the lapel having close mounted mikes having people adjust them as they're most - as - as - as comfortable as they can ==__c1
__s__well i ==__c0
__s^bk__i think that's sort of the big deal .__c1
__s^aa|s^na__i agree with that .__c0
__s^aa__and so my feeling is we should get mikes that people like .__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__yeah .__ca
__s.%-__and so i- - my feeling is going out and buying a few more mikes is fine .__c0
__s^aa|s__yeah .__c1
__fh__yeah | that's right .__c3
__s__so should i just go do that ?__c0
__b.%__yeah .__c1
__b.%__okay .__c0
__s__what about these ?==__c2
__b.%__and then also should we go ahead and get another wireless system ?__c0
__qh^e__you know for whatever it's going to be uh ==__c0
__%-__uhhuh .__ca
__s^aa|s__uh another wireless system .__c1
__s.%-__you mean another transmitter ?__c1
__s^no__or - or ?==__c1
__s.%--__uh no | actually get - we need another box .__c0
__s__because each - each box in the back room can only take six .__c0
__s^bk__oh | to get r- - to get rid of the wired things .__c1
__s.%--__so we could- ==__c0
__b__yep .__c0
__b.%__yes absolutely .__c1
__s^f|s__okay .__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__b.%__uh because - because we've had - with the exception of forgetting to change the batteries from time to time uh we've really had no tr- - no trouble with this at all .__c1
__s__so i'll just go d- - i'll do that .__c0
__s__yep .__c0
__s__right ?__c1
__b.%__and - and the wired stuff is just going to continue to degrade as you know ==__c1
__s__and nobody will remember how to ==__c1
__b__another one just bit the dust .__c2
__s__yeah | nobody will remember how to repair a jimbox or a jimlet or a ==__c1
__s__really ?__c5
__s.%-__i think there's a problem with this one .__c2
__s^aap__yep .__c0
__s^df.%--__you know it's ==__c1
__%--__okay | then i will just go do that .__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__and send the bill to uh what's her name ?__c0
__s^e__whoever will pay .__c1
__b.%__yeah .__c1
__s^e__whoever will pay .__c0
__s__you .__c0
__s__yeah yeah .__c1
__b__i have a quick question about microphones .__c2
__s^e__um ==__c2
__b__i got this crazy idea that um i- - in the future people will just walk around with the microphones that they use for their cell phones .__c2
__b__you know these little boom ones .__c2
__fh__like and really go to meetings with close talking mikes .__c2
__s^am|s^aa__if they're their own personal microphone .__c2
__%-__and so i'm wondering if we can get a couple of tho- ==__c2
__qh__i don't know how good quality they are .__c2
__b__but it would be really interesting to see if they're good enough .__c2
__b__do you mean the kind that hang from the ear sort of thing ?__c1
__b__the k- - kind that guys that like to look like they're really cool at airports wear .__c2
__b__or the ?==__c1
__fg__yeah .__c3
__%-__yeah .__c0
__qw^t3__yeah | but i don't know that one .__c1
__fg|s__so what's that mean ?__c1
__fh__this - it's - it's a cell phone jack .__c0
__qw.%-__you can't miss it .__c2
__b__oh yeah you do .__c5
__s^bk__you cannot miss it .__c2
__fh__is this - just this little ==__c1
__s.%--__they're the guys going around ==__c2
__s.%--__they're probably talking to nobody .__c2
__s.%--__but ==__c2
__s__oh | they - they have little headsets ?__c1
__s__yep .__c3
__s__th- - d- ==__c0
__s__yes .__c2
__b__or what do they ?==__c1
__s__yep .__c0
__s__they wear the heads- ==__c2
__b__e- - well there you go .__c2
__b__oh you've - you've got one .__c1
__s__yes !__c2
__s__that's - that - it looks sort of like that .__c2
__b__except that one's even bigger than most of the ones i've seen .__c0
__s^f__so where - where does - how do you wear that ?__c1
__s__most of the ones are just a little boom .__c0
__s__what does that ?==__c1
__s__you - you put it over the corner of your ear .__ca
__b__yeah | over the corner of the ear .__c1
__b__i can't - i'm having competing microphone - headphone problems here .__ca
__s^bk__there's another kind which s- - goes in your ear .__c5
__qy.%--__huh ==__c1
__s^bk__and it hangs down .__c5
__s__there's a little b- - bulb ==__c5
__s.%-__yep | it just ha- - just hangs down there .__c3
__s^bk__yeah | that i've seen .__c1
__qy^d^f^g__yeah .__c1
__b__that hangs - has the mike on it .__c5
__s__okay | so whatever people sort of wear to use l- ==__c2
__s^ba__this one .__ca
__b__yeah .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__s__yeah | something like tha- - with their cell phones .__c2
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^bk__it'd be really great i think if we can argue t- - that .__c2
__fg|s^rt^t^tc__it's an interesting idea .__ca
__s.%--__people like that .__c2
__b__the acoustics ==__ca
__s^cc^rt__the acoustics on this are really s- - m- - better than when i talk into it directly .__ca
__s__yeah | the - the biggest issue is the stupid cable .__c0
__s^t__but - what ==__c1
__s^bk__are they ?__c2
__fh|qy^bu^d^rt__why would it be cool ?__c1
__b.%__that sony ==__c0
__s^aa|s__the connector that sony has that uh ==__c0
__s^df__oh okay .__c2
__s^ba|s^bk__so it's - they're not compatible ?__c2
__s^ba__it's non standard .__c0
__qw__and so you can't just plug something in .__c0
__s^df__you need to get it wired .__c0
__s__oh | i'm sorry .__c1
__s.%-__you're talking about that as a possible thing to plug into the sonys .__c1
__s^bk__well ==__c2
__s__um | just as an example for you know the future of the fact that maybe people will wear those microphones .__c2
__s__right .__c0
__s__no ?__c1
__s__how standard are these ?__c5
__s__works with this .__ca
__s__i don't know .__ca
__s__or some people might .__c2
__b__well some people will | yeah .__c1
__s__to meetings .__c2
__s^cc__you know .__c2
__qh^cs.%-__not a - i'm not saying there's not a far field microphone uh application .__c2
__s^bk__but ==__c2
__fg__if we have a choi- - i've always wondered how well they would work .__c2
__qy^rt__it is an interesting idea .__c5
__s^aa|s.%-__if we could build an adaptor that went from ==__c5
__fh__because i think mine looks like this too .__c5
__s^aa__if we had this style plug that went to that then we'd just have adaptors .__c5
__qrr__right .__c0
__s.%__and people would plug them in .__c5
__s^am__you could use - they could use their own .__c5
__%--__oh right | so they could use the ==__c2
__s^bk__i wonder if you could do an adaptor .__c0
__s^bk__i don't know if you can or not .__c0
__s^cs__anyway it's just an idea .__c2
__s^ba__yeah .__c1
__s__um ==__c2
__s^df__an adaptor might be a better idea than do- - redoing the wiring all the time .__c0
__s|qy^d^g__huh ==__c2
__s__well i mean another s- ==__c1
__s__an- - another side to that is that um in principle uh if it all comes together supposedly we're going to get two um i ram boards .__c1
__s^aa__right .__c0
__b__uh little later on in the year .__c1
__s^bk__and so we're going to want to be thinking in terms of some wireless connection to it .__c1
__fg|s^tc__uhhuh .__c0
__s|qy^d^f^g__um ==__c1
__fh__so we have you know some kind of little something .__c1
__s.%--__and uh we have a wireless connection this board that's doing the computation for the f- - the uh the recognition .__c1
__s^rt__and so you know we want to be able to show off to somebody .__c1
__s__you know we have a base station somewhere .__c1
__fh__and you're wandering around uh hands free .__c1
__s|qy^d^f^g__and ==__c1
__s__yep .__c0
__%-__i don't understand .__c5
__%--__so - so there's a mike that plugs in ==__c5
__s^fa__you're saying there's a mike that plugs in to the i ram board ?__c5
__s__no no | what i'm saying is that we're going to have to put together some kind of a little superstructure d- - some sort of demo box that it - that doesn't do a whole lot .__c1
__fh__or ?==__c5
__%__demo .__c0
__s^aa__but it somehow connects to uh remotely to this i ram board .__c1
__s^m|qy^d^f^g__which will be doing the real computation .__c1
__s^aa__oh i see .__c5
__s|qy^d^f^g__in other words we're - we're not going to attempt to build uh it do the real work of building a portable device that's little that is doing all the computation we want to do for the recognition and the far field mike uh compensation and all that stuff .__c1
__qw__so we're going to do all that on this powerful board .__c1
__s.%--__and uh have some wireless connection to it .__c1
__s.%-__and then the question is what is - what does it look like ?__c1
__s^co.%-__does it look like something that you - you hold like this ?__c1
__s^bk__or do we make a big deal out of it that you hold it arm - at arm's length th- - so that you can see some display ?__c1
__s.%--__or uh ==__c1
__s:s__do we have one of these ?==__c1
__s:s__you know i don't know .__c1
__s:s__so it th- - these are all possibilities .__c1
__s^bk__yep .__c0
__qy^d^f^g__i mean what i was envisioning was a p d a with a cellular link in it .__c0
__s|qy^d^f^g__you know with one of the r- - short range wireless .__c0
__s^e^t3__and let th- - just do - capture the audio on the p d a and send the audio over the wireless net .__c0
__s.%--__yeah | so is- - is bluetooth the sort of thing that'd be uh ?==__c1
__b__but ==__c0
__s^t3__uh bluetooth is shorter range .__c0
__s__but you could use bluetooth .__c0
__b.%__wh- - whatever the network guys already have hooked up for this floor .__c0
__s^t3__i don't remember what it's called .__c0
__s.%--__huh ==__c1
__s^no__okay | then uh another issue on file reorganization is uh making data available to people outside icsi .__c0
__s^df^rt__so specifically the u w folks have been wanting to get access to it .__c0
__s.%--__so i think the right thing to do for that is figure out how to do c v s without uh compromising security .__c0
__s^ba^bd__some pass- - s s h tunneled c v s .__c0
__s:s__well i- - i was ==__c5
__s.%--__and then give them access .__c0
__s^rt.%--__i was reading through some of the c v s documentation .__c5
__s^bk|s__and you can just substitute c v s for your r s h command .__c5
__qy^d^f^g__yes | except that the command has to not take a password .__c0
__s.%--__huh ==__c5
__s__because it- - it's non interactive .__c0
__qy^d^f^g__and so the only way to do that is with uh s hosts .__c0
__s__which is insecure .__c0
__s__huh ==__c5
__s__so we still have to sort of look at it a little bit .__c0
__s__i mean i'm sure it's been solved .__c0
__s__and i just haven't found the solution yet .__c0
__s__but i am sure that people have done it .__c0
__fh|s__because it's going to be a problem a lot of people have .__c0
__fh__but um ==__c0
__qw^t1__who - well we're s- - talking about a fairly limited group .__c1
__s:s__are - are - is it a small enough group that they would - could just have accounts ?__c1
__s__does that solve anything ?__c1
__s^f__uh n- - n- - not really .__c0
__s__because then we have the coordination issue .__c0
__s__i mean so one thing they could do ==__c0
__fh__i mean i guess that's true .__c0
__qy^d^f^g__they could simply log in to icsi ==__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__s.%--__well they're going to have to have accounts ==__c5
__s__and do everything locally .__c0
__%-__if they use s s h they have to have an account anyways .__c5
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah | except they could share one .__c0
__s^aa__well | but that's not ==__c1
__s^bk__the uh the s s h accounts and the user accounts don't have to be similar .__c0
__s__so ==__c0
__b__i mean there are lots of ways of doing it .__c0
__s|qy^d^f^g__but w- - but if we can't figure out a remote way of doing it just letting them log in to icsi might be okay .__c0
__s^rt:s^rt__uhhuh .__c2
__s^bu__so the intention was to put everything except the audio files themselves under revision control .__c0
__s^aa__and the audio files it's not worth doing .__c0
__s^ba__because they're too big .__c0
__s|qy^d^f^g__you're never going to be copying them around and making working copies of them .__c0
__s__right .__c1
__s^e__and then the other issue jane and i spoke of briefly is just general permission issues .__c0
__s.%--__that right now lots of people create the files .__c0
__s.%--__and then we have group meeting recorder .__c0
__s__but that means anyone in the meeting recorder group can overwrite the files .__c0
__s__and so that's a pretty coarse level of granularity .__c0
__s^rt__so we might want to think about doing a meeting recorder user - owner for those files .__c0
__s__and then doing group slightly differently .__c0
__s__but ==__c0
__qy^d^f^g__i think what we have now ==__c0
__s__can you just do like s u x or something to modify ?==__c2
__qy^d^f^g__i mean if you just have one user that ==__c2
__s^df__another option is to m- - make a non make it owned by a not real user .__c0
__s__and then root will be able to do it .__c0
__s|qy^d^f^g__but root is pretty tightly controlled here .__c0
__s:s|qy^d^f^g__uhhuh .__c2
__s^rt:s__i had another thought .__ca
__qy^d^f^g__so th- - i don't think that's a good solution .__c0
__fg|s__would - w- - would it be possi- ?==__ca
__s__there are scripts that uh run .__ca
__s^e__and - and when it's finished compressing would it be possible for the script to change the permissions on the file to be more strict ?__ca
__s^f__have them ==__ca
__s__yes | but if you do that then someone who isn't the owner can't unchange it .__c0
__s__but after the meeting's done would they want to ?__ca
__fh__yeah | as i said it's just a question of uh do you want to have to track down root if you have to make any change ?__c0
__s__but it doesn't have to be root .__c2
__b.%__it could be some other user that we all can s u x to .__c2
__s^bu__that's true .__ca
__s^no__you have security issues with that .__c0
__s.%--__so ==__c0
__b__yeah | that's true .__ca
__s__i mean ==__c2
__s^ba__that's what we do with doctor speech though .__c5
__s^m^na__right ?__c5
__s^aa__no | with doctor speech it's just a group .__c0
__qy^rt__so - there're lots of different owners of i- - i- - of the files but the group is always doctor speech .__c0
__s^cs__or real usually .__c0
__s^bk|s^cs__but there is a user doctor speech .__c5
__s^bk__right ?__c5
__s__i mean i - i s u x to doctor speech w- - when i need to make a - a directory on uh one of the ==__c5
__%--__nnn- ==__c0
__s^aa__oh | do you ?__c0
__s^na|s^aa__oh | so tha- - that's what i meant .__c2
__s^bk__it - just some user like meeting root or something .__c2
__s.%--__oh okay .__c0
__b.%__i don't know .__c2
__fg|s^ba__i mean i'm not too worried .__c0
__s^bk__because the group's pretty small .__c0
__fh__but ==__c0
__qw__yeah .__c1
__s^bk|s^ba__also it seems like once it's been stored that night it's - it's possible to recover from backups .__ca
__h|s__so that the main risk is avoiding it being accidentally deleted during the day that it was recorded .__ca
__s^bk__well and just - you then also just have the general problem of permission on the other files .__c0
__s|qy^d^f^g__that do you want people checking out a transcript file when they find an error and correcting it ?__c0
__s^aa|s.%--__or do they wa- - do you want it to go through you ?__c0
__s.%--:s__yeah yeah .__ca
__s^cs__and i'd prefer it to go through me .__ca
__s__okay | but that means that you're going to have to be available for people all the time who say there's an error here .__c0
__b.%__rather than just - them just going in and correcting it .__c0
__s^e__well i p- - at this point ==__ca
__fh|s__well with c v s though you don't actually have to do it that way .__c5
__s^cs__yeah .__ca
__s^cs__yeah .__c2
__s^cs^e__well but you have a choice .__c0
__b__either you let people do it themselves or you don't .__c0
__s^nd__yeah .__ca
__b.%__what i'm saying is that it can be the case that people can do it themselves and it can be reviewed .__c5
__s^df__w- - w- ==__ca
__b__well- ==__ca
__s^bk__right ?__c5
__qy^d^f^g__right .__c0
__s__i mean it's not like it's one or the other .__c5
__s__we can do both .__c5
__%--__yeah | you can ==__c2
__s^ar|s.%--__right | so you could get email .__c0
__s__send email to jane that someone has done a revision .__c0
__s^df__right .__c5
__s__i - i want to also say that you know this is a ==__ca
__qy__uh uh my - my view on this is that once it's in a final version and i'm working toward all these being final versions then it can go into this next ro- - this next realm .__ca
__s__but it - it's sort of counter productive to have changes made which i would be making if i'd just gotten that far in the file .__ca
__s^df__you know it's - it's um ==__ca
__s^fa^t1__well so you don't have to release it to the world until you're ready to .__c0
__s^bk__yeah .__ca
__qh__that's right .__ca
__s^aa__so the question is s- - w- ?==__c0
__fh__and then after that then this would probably work .__ca
__%--__yeah .__ca
__b.%__so you would keep it in a separate file structure until you were ready to put it in the repository .__c0
__s^bk__good good .__ca
__s^m.%--__i mean ==__c2
__qw^br__or just keep the lock on it .__c0
__s__is c v s like ?==__c2
__s.%-__yeah | just keep the lock on .__c2
__b.%__i mean just check it out - check it out .__c2
__s^bk|qy^bu^d__until you're ==__c0
__s^ba__yep .__c0
__s^df__and don't let anyone check it out ==__c2
__s^aa|s__no | it does not - the c v s doesn't work that way .__c5
__s__oh .__c2
__s^f|s__it - oh it doesn't .__c2
__s.%--__there's no - there's no lock when you check something out .__c5
__fh__oh okay .__c2
__s__not like r c s .__c5
__s__in other words everybody can check out anything .__c5
__b.%__oh .__c2
__s__the c stands for concurrent .__c5
__s^e__so why not use r c s at that point just at that stage ?__c2
__s__because it's not remote .__c0
__qh__it's not remote .__c2
__s__the nice thing about c v s is - is you can be on a different machine .__c0
__b.%__but at that point we only want probably jane to be in control anyway .__c2
__s^aa__and she ==__c2
__s^bk__i mean it's just an i- ==__c2
__s^rt__no | because u w wants to have access to these files .__c0
__s|qy^d^f^g__that's the whole point .__c0
__s^rt__but not to modify them .__c2
__b.%__right ?__c2
__s__just to read them .__c2
__s^2__well if they k- - en- - if they record a meeting and they create a key file and they find an error in their key file they shouldn't have to tell us about that .__c0
__b.%__so that they can create correct an error in one of their files .__c0
__s^aa__well the key file is ==__ca
__s^aap__so that's why i want to do it ==__c0
__s^aa__i don't know .__c2
__%--__ke- - key file's different .__ca
__s^aa__uh - i mean ==__c2
__s__key fi- ==__ca
__%--__different than what ?__c0
__s^no__well key file has the extra attributes that if you notice that there are lots of spikes on channel .__ca
__s__so-and-so and it's useful as a repository for putting that there .__ca
__s.%--__and also if you notice that there was an extra speaker .__ca
__s^ar__and didn't get mentioned in the key file .__ca
__s:s__but they were only there for a second .__ca
__s^df:s__but it's t- - useful to mention that they were there .__ca
__fg|s:s__so i th- - i think that the key file is usefu- - for notations related to the meeting .__ca
__s^na:s__well ==__c0
__s.%-__b- ==__c0
__b__but i mean the meetings are going to be the same way .__c0
__s:s__but it's different from the transcript .__ca
__s^aa|s^bd__so u w records a meeting .__c0
__s^bk__we transcribe it .__c0
__fh__yeah .__ca
__s^df.%--__a few months later they listen to it .__c0
__s__and they say ope they got that acronym wrong .__c0
__%-__yeah .__ca
__s^aa|s^na__then they should send that through ==__c2
__s__why - why sh- ==__c0
__s^bk__well it's sort of not really a question about permissions .__c2
__s.%--__but more of procedure .__c2
__s:s__either those all go through jane or through someone .__c2
__s^aap__uhhuh .__c0
__s^df__or they all don't .__c2
__s^aa|s^na__but it's sort of ==__c2
__s^bk__and if they all do then there isn't a problem .__c2
__fh__right ?__c2
__fg__because once they give us the data it's ours .__c2
__fh__and if they want to make changes ==__c2
__s.%--__i mean ours to sort of transcribe and annotate .__c2
__s__the - the p- - the point here is that it would be nice t- - for there to be one repository .__c0
__s__and if they want to make changes they can do that .__c2
__fh__yeah .__c1
__%--__yeah .__ca
__s^ba__and if we don't let them modify their own data they're not going to store their data in our repository .__c0
__b.%__or if we make it inconvenient for them to change their data .__c0
__fh__so then if they do have acc- ==__c2
__s__i - i'm just looking at it the other way around .__c0
__s__okay | so what if they have what if they have accounts here and they use r c s ?__c2
__s:s__so - so let's say we k- ==__c0
__s__at that point where you can l- - really lock a file .__c2
__s:s__i mean i'm worried if you can't lock a file this - this to me sounds very scary .__c2
__s:s__huh .__ca
__s^rt:s__um ==__c2
__b__and if they have accounts here and they're modifying it ==__c2
__s^e__if they're ac- - if they're so closely linked that they're actually modifying transcripts and key files then they could do it by you know secure shelling into icsi under r c s at that point .__c2
__s__ye- - well i don't see a real difference between r c s and any other system .__c0
__fh__i mean it's just mechanisms .__c0
__s.%--__the nice thing about c v s is that you can have multiple people modifying .__c0
__s__and if the changes don't overlap each other they can just do it .__c0
__qw__huh ==__ca
__s__that's interesting .__ca
__s__so the problem with r c s is that if two people want to modify a file at the same time they can't .__c0
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^bk__because the granularity of locking is at the file level .__c0
__fg__what- - what does c v s do if they - if they do overlap ?__c1
__s__uh there're lots of different policies for dealing with it .__c0
__fg__uhhuh .__c2
__fg|%--__but typically a person has to uh mediate you know which changes actually get - go through .__c5
__s__so ==__c0
__s^df__yeah .__c3
__b__oh .__ca
__s__yeah | to decide which one is ==__c3
__s__oh .__ca
__s.%--__yeah .__c3
__s:s__oh i- ==__c1
__s:s__so maybe there is a way in c v s to effectively lock something if you don't want people to make any changes ?__c2
__s__at the repository level there certainly is .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s^bk__you can mark a file as - as you can't check this out .__c0
__qy^rt__oh .__c2
__s^aa__so ==__c2
__s^bk__c v s is pretty good .__c5
__s:s__so then you could use c v s .__c2
__%--__and you know just f- - have remote access .__c2
__s__okay .__c1
__s:s__yep .__c0
__s^bk__but then it's up to whoever is sort of responsible for that level of transcription to decide how and when to put these locks .__c2
__b__well it's - it's just like source code .__c0
__s__or ==__c2
__s__right ?__c0
__s__so that when you're developing it and it's really rough you don't put it in the repository .__c0
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__you wait to the point when you're ready to release it .__c0
__s__and then you put it in the repository .__c0
__s__yeah | so the w- ==__c5
__b__uhhuh .__ca
__s__and if other people want to copy ==__c0
__b__in- ==__c5
__s__the - maybe the model ==__c5
__s__it's a little bit different in c v s .__c5
__b__when you check something out you actually create your own directory with copies of everything in it .__c5
__qy^rt__copy .__c0
__fh__and that's what you work on .__c5
__%-__so until you're ready to check it in nobody sees anything you've done .__c5
__s^aa__and then when you check it in it puts sort of you know - every change that you've done is - goes into the central ==__c5
__s^bu__right .__c2
__s^bu.%-__so if that's at an- ==__c2
__s^aa__huh ==__c1
__s.%-__i guess it depends on jane's ==__c2
__s.%--__uh you know ==__c2
__s__if that's - if that model works for the transcripts then that's fine .__c2
__s.%--__but if that pr- - um allows someone to come in and modify while you're modifying and they turn out to be changes that you know would have been better to wait until your version came out then that's really up to you .__c2
__s.%--__not up to the software .__c2
__s__an- - i think it's a very good point .__ca
__s.%--__because what if the - uh what if one set of changes one person was making was with reference to some typographical convention ?__ca
__%-__uhhuh .__c0
__fg|s__and the other person n- - unkn- - n- - quite unknowingly was changing it the other way around .__ca
__%-__then you could end up with a real mess .__ca
__s^aa__in terms of like consistency of conventions across a file there is an argument to be made for having a single editor editing at that level .__ca
__%-__but i like b- - i like what liz is saying about ==__ca
__s^aa__well yeah | there would - there would have to be somebody to enforce the consistency .__c5
__fg__that's right .__ca
__%--__and i also like - i l- - also like liz's uh k- - um phraseology of at this level of - i don't remember how you put it but this - at this level of transcription or whatever .__ca
__fh__yeah .__c5
__s.%--__i mean it's like there are different layers of whatever .__ca
__s__and different types of conventions .__ca
__s__and if it were an acronym then i would - i think that it would make sense f- - for them to have input into that level of things .__ca
__s__but i wouldn't want them to be changing ==__ca
__s__i'm just ==__c0
__%--__imagine that we reverse this .__c0
__s^e__and they were keeping the repository and we were d- - collecting meetings and sending them to them .__c0
__s__yeah .__ca
__s^ba__uhhuh .__ca
__s__if i found an error and i sent them email and said here's this error and i didn't get a response for a couple weeks i would stop sending them the - my data .__c0
__s__and i would start collecting it here .__c0
__s^aa__and we would end up with two corpora .__c0
__fh__well ==__ca
__b__and i don't want that to happen .__c0
__s__yeah .__ca
__s__i agree .__ca
__fh__so we have to make it convenient for them to make changes that they want to make .__c0
__s__well ==__ca
__s^df__well i see now we're k- - back into the same situation as when we were uh talking about a- - allowing people to edit the transcripts before they become public .__ca
__s^df^e__so there's a question of how easy or how hard to modify .__ca
__s__and how that impacts the amount of changing that's done .__ca
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__qh^df__and i - i think that it's um ==__ca
__%-__i - i have received some suggestions for change which i've made .__ca
__s.%-__and um i think with an acronym that's a clear case where it would be an easy change to incorporate .__ca
__s.%--__but it would worry me to have people um having free reign to change these things because of the need to have consistent conventions .__ca
__b__and people who are only just visiting the data might not have a sense of the larger system .__ca
__s__yeah | that's what i would be worried about too .__c2
__qh^rt__well i think ==__c5
__qh^e__yeah | i think there are probably ways that you can say that you know only certain users are allowed to change things .__c5
__s^bk__yeah .__ca
__s__uhhuh .__ca
__s.%--__uh so we can probably restrict it to be ==__c5
__%-__you know f- - casual users who are just browsing can just r- - get it read only .__c5
__qw^df__can't check in to the archive .__c5
__s^df__uhhuh .__ca
__s^aa|s__whereas we could say other people you know these people are allowed to actually submit changes .__c5
__s^e__right .__c2
__s__i mean i - i think one thing that's probably everybody would agree on is that there will never be a point where you know we can say that for sure there's no problems with any of the transcripts .__c5
__s__i mean there's ==__c5
__s^df__uh - f- - you know something's going to get overlooked at some point .__c5
__s^aa|s__or somebody's going to want to make a change somehow .__c5
__s^bk|qy^df__so we need to have some mechanism for um handling changes in the future .__c5
__h__i agr- - i agree | but i have to also add one other thing which i- - before i forget it .__ca
__s^bk__which is adam's point about when you were reviewing the i b m transcripts .__ca
__s__u- - this was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting .__ca
__s__you said that there were some places where it wasn't what y- - was written already but you could see how they might have thought that's what it said .__ca
__s^ar|s__so there - it's not just a right and wrong thing .__ca
__s.%--__sometimes there tru- - there are absolutely stretches where there is no - no - k- - if you were at the meeting and you could ask the person .__ca
__s__yeah exactly .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__maybe m- - you know they could - they could've told you .__ca
__s__but five minutes later they might not have been able to tell you .__ca
__s|qy^d^f^g__right .__c5
__s^e__even if they were listening to it .__ca
__s^f__so sometimes it isn't right and wrong .__ca
__b.%__yeah .__c5
__fg|s.%--__sometimes it's multiple interpretations .__ca
__b.%__and ==__ca
__s__good point .__c5
__s.%--__yeah .__c5
__b__now - but of course this does raise the possibility of allowing um an extra annotation for you know alternative interpretations of a stretch .__ca
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s.%--__but i just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong .__ca
__s.%--__yeah | that's a good point .__c5
__s__or overlooked or not overlooked .__ca
__fg|%--__sometimes they're truly ambiguous .__ca
__s^aa|s.%-__and um uh um ==__ca
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__s__nice to have a notation for that .__ca
__s__got to go .__c1
__s__but yeah .__ca
__s__yeah .__c5
__s__i mean i like that idea .__c2
__b__because even a casual user can always send email to whoever's in charge .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__b__and say you know we'd like these changes .__c2
__s__well ==__c0
__b.%__and you know hopefully we'll give them a response .__c2
__b.%__i just - i don't s- ==__c0
__s^fe__and if they really do it a lot and they say we're a casual user but we want a chance to change the transcripts then we can face that if it happens .__c2
__s:s^fe__i don't see that this is e- ==__c0
__s__yep .__c0
__s__can you write unread on that ?__c0
__s^aa__but ==__c2
__s__yeah | thank you .__c0
__fh__i don't really see the people at u w that i know of right now making huge amoun- - investing huge amounts of time in changing transcripts .__c2
__s^cs__but i could be wrong .__c2
__s.%-__probably not transcripts .__c0
__s__but it would be nice to have one mechanism for all the files .__c0
__s^aa|s^ba__and they're certainly going to want to change tools .__c0
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__and so - you know it's the same as source code .__c0
__s^rt__you - you release source code at some point .__c0
__s.%-__and either you have to do everything or you share responsibility .__c0
__s^df__yeah | i mean a lot of the open source pro- - projects face this same problem .__c5
__fh__right .__c2
__s^f__you know p- - anybody can check out the code .__c5
__s^aa|s^cs__but not everybody can check it in .__c5
__s^df.%--__right | and there's some happy medium .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c5
__s^bk__and we don't know what that is yet until we get feedback from people .__c2
__s.%--__but what if it's okay to just handle it with sort of a person in charge of the philosophy behind the changes ?__c2
__s.%--__and some people with permissions maybe by request to make changes .__c2
__s__that we don't just give people permissions if they're not going to make changes .__c2
__s__because i've overwritten a - a file by mistake .__c2
__s.%-:s__not wanting to have done that .__c2
__s__because i didn't think i had permission when i did .__c2
__qy^d^g^rt__uhhuh .__c0
__s.%-__um and then just seeing if that is enough to - to handle the transcript changes .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__ca
__s^no^rt__i'm just worried about letting everybody go in and make changes .__c2
__qh__because it's real easy when you're trying to i don't know run alignments and there's a word you want to fix to go in and do that and then mess up other things .__c2
__s^no__if you don't know you know the overall philosophy behind the - the conventions .__c2
__s^ar|s^df.%--__uhhuh .__ca
__s__right .__c0
__s^e__then - there is also the possibility - remember in c v s when we talk about making changes there's sort of two types that can be made .__c5
__s^e__and als- - it also- ==__ca
__s^bk|s^ba__uhhuh .__ca
__s^df__you can back everything out .__c0
__qh__to your local or to the global .__c5
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s.%-__and so people can make changes to their local .__c5
__%--__right .__c2
__s^bk|s^ba__and if they screw those up that's you know in their - that's only on them .__c5
__s.%-__exactly .__c2
__s^bk|s^df.%-__uhhuh .__ca
__b.%__it's w- - it's the checking in part that r- - we really care about .__c5
__s^bk|s^na__and that we can control with you know who can check things in and stuff .__c5
__s:s__so we can - i think we can do this .__c5
__s:s__or just yeah start by make it a really tight control .__c2
__%__uhhuh .__ca
__s__uhhuh .__c5
__b.%__and then as people really need the control you can ascertain whether or not to ==__c2
__s^df__yeah | they can still check it out ==__c5
__b__yeah | because they can still check out full copies and make whatever changes they want to their local copies .__c5
__s__right .__c2
__fh__and it won't affect the - the g- - the global official ones at all .__c5
__s^df__right .__c2
__b.%__right | but what i want to avoid is ending up with two corpora .__c0
__s^no__yeah .__c3
__s^df__yes .__c5
__s__definitely .__c5
__s^na__and so if you make it too hard for them to check back in they'll check it out once .__c0
__s^bd__yep .__c5
__s^bd__they'll make all the changes .__c0
__s^df__they'll never tell us about the changes .__c0
__b.%__uhhuh .__c5
__b__and we'll get two different corpora .__c0
__s^nd.%--__uhhuh .__c5
__s__right ?__c0
__s|qy^d^f^g__i think we're already going to - i mean there's already some chance that different annotations different places you know ==__c2
__s__but you can control that by knowing you're making two corpora .__c2
__s__or knowing that you're adding um annotations on one version and you don't have the latest corrections maybe at that point .__c2
__s__and then you finish the project and you realize that there were corrections made on your originals .__c2
__s^na__and then you have to merge them .__c2
__s^df.%--__and the b- - the thing that makes it ea- - okay to do that is knowing where the synch time boundaries are .__c2
__s__because you can automatically pretty much merge things if you've only got twenty words or so in an utterance .__c2
__s^e__it's when you get the whole meeting .__c2
__b__and the synch times ch- - have changed .__c2
__s:s__or you can't correspond to a previous version with synch times that you get in trouble .__c2
__b__so ==__c2
__s__was there anything else on your list ?__c2
__s^cs__nope .__c0
__s^am^cs__shall we do some digits ?__c0
__fh__DIGIT_TASK__c0
__s^no__now wait | are - are we doing them simultaneously or one at a time ?__c2
__s^cs__i wasn't planning on doing it simultaneously .__c0
__s^e__all right .__c2
__s^bu__lee you liked that l- ==__c5
__s^aa__DIGIT_TASK__c0
__fg|s__huh ?__c5
__fh__DIGIT_TASK__c2
__s^bk__DIGIT_TASK__c5
__s^bk__DIGIT_TASK__ca
__fh__DIGIT_TASK__c3
__b__oop ouch !__c0
__%-__ooo !__ca
