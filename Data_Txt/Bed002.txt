__s__yeah i do it my head's too big also .__c0
__s__or i like it also like this .__c3
__s^cs^rt__okay yeah .__c1
__s__yeah i - i just tried it .__c4
__s__so you see the ==__c3
__s__i think my head is too big .__c4
__qw__so ==__c3
__%--__and there is a problem that you can hear it come and go .__c8
__s__it's too ba- ==__c0
__s^aa__because when you turn your head then you drift away from the microphone .__c8
__s__oh yeah .__c4
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__oh that's true .__c0
__qy__okay | so let's uh ==__c1
__s^ar__the distance isn't ==__c4
__s^bk__course that's true of a lapel as well .__c0
__s^ar^r__let's discuss agenda items .__c1
__s^e__i should have brought more ==__c3
__s__what did we have ?__c1
__s__yes .__c8
__s^na__uh you - you were announce some things .__c1
__s__i have a couple things about speaker form ==__c3
__s^t3__about forms in general .__c3
__s__okay forms is one thing .__c1
__s^2__uh there's status on on the uh transcription discussion which will take us about thirty seconds .__c1
__s^aa__stuff .__c3
__s^bk__uh and then uh jose as usual uh the one among us who's actually doing a bunch of things on this .__c1
__fg|s__uh he has this and i think we can have some ==__c1
__b__i was just glancing through it so i think we have something to discuss about .__c1
__fh__uhhuh .__c2
__s__um and um we just sent in that uh n s f pre proposal .__c1
__s__but i don't think there's much to say about that except we've sent it in and we'll see what happens .__c1
__s__um | anybody ?__c1
__s__anything ?__c1
__s__anything else going on ?__c1
__s__that's it .__c8
__fh__no .__c1
__s__okay .__c1
__b.%__so | why don't we do it in that order ?__c1
__s__okay .__c3
__s^bk__go ahead .__c1
__qh^cs__i uh probably should have printed out more of these .__c3
__s^cs^e__so one of the things that i've been doing with the digits forms is i've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them .__c3
____and it's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time .__c3
__z__so what i thought was it would be nice to have a single speaker form that you fill out once .__c3
__z__and then on the digits form you just have to put your name down and you can look it up from the speaker form .__c3
____so i had a first pass of it .__c3
____and i spoke with jane a bit about how to specify what language and education and that sort of stuff .__c3
____and so i have a first pass at it .__c3
____and i was uh just wondering if people had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it .__c3
__s^ft__and i only did one copy which was really stupid of me .__c3
__s__um so i'll just sort of say what it's on and then i can hand it around .__c3
__s__so the top of it is uh name sex email or other contact information .__c3
__s__and i put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name so that you can distinguish them .__c3
__s^e__and then also just to have a separate contact from the consent form .__c3
__s^df__and then uh we talked a little bit about whether to do - how we get at the background .__c3
__s^df__and we could do profession but it's so uniform that we figured what was more important was actually the education level .__c3
__fh__um at least that would get at some idea of their background .__c3
__s^ba__so i have a - and s- ==__c3
__fh__well - | and it's also relevant to status .__c8
__s__i c- - i can insert that .__c8
__s.%--__and relevant to status .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__so that what i have is uh ==__c3
__s__status ?__c4
__fh__which might in- - af- - affect the discourse aspects .__c8
__s__so go ahead .__c8
__s.%--__oh - oh stats kind of status okay .__c4
__s^bd^df__his ==__c8
__s__uhhuh yeah .__c8
__s__so - uh i have uh five things that you can circle .__c3
__fh__categories .__c8
__s__undergrad grad post doc professor and then other with a colon and a place where you can fill in if there's some other .__c3
__qy^rt__so i think the problem with that is that there's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our visitors who are not used to the u s education levels .__c3
__h|s^aa__and may need some help to translate what that means .__c3
__qrr.%--__how fine a resolution do you need on that for this ?__c1
__s^ar|s__is the question .__c2
__qy__i mean maybe not so much .__c1
__%--__uhhuh .__c3
__s^na__student non student .__c4
__s^na__oh i think undergrad is useful .__c8
__s^bk|s.%--__can you just write something like position ?__c0
__s^bk__and people can fill in their own you know post doc or visitor or whatever .__c0
__s__p- - prone .__c1
__fh__yeah .__c1
__qy^rt__sitting .__c4
__s__well the problem with that is um i think the same as the problem of profession .__c3
__s^bk__@reject@ .__c2
__s^e__that it - it will be - there will be a tendency all - for everyone to put down speech researcher or - or something at that granularity .__c3
__s^bk__oh .__c0
__s__so i don't think there's a problem asking the education level i th- - at least i don't feel like there is .__c3
__s.%-__um i think the only question is whether the - what categories should there be ?__c3
__s^df__yeah .__c8
__s^bk__i think that ==__c8
__s.%-__so uh - did - are - were you suggesting that it should be more fine grained than this ?__c8
__s^aa|s:qw__no no .__c1
__b__less .__c1
__s^bk__less .__c3
__s__less ?__c8
__b__what would you suggest as a - as a change ?__c8
__b__um huh um | well do you think there's ?==__c1
__fh__i don't really know .__c1
__fh__i mean were you thinking uh that it would be useful for some research later to know say you said undergrad for instance so undergrad versus grad ?__c1
__s^no__uhhuh uhhuh .__c8
__s^bk__do you think that's important ?__c1
__b__i do and the reason is because i think that um well having been a grad student as yeah a- - as others here at - at berkeley that um i think there's almost like a quantum leap from undergrad to grad in terms of like the status .__c8
__s^df__okay .__c1
__s^df__i mean i mean you notice it in various ways like simply trying to meet with a professor during office hours .__c8
__s^bk__you know in - in my department it was always the case grad students had a huge amount of different priority .__c8
__s^bk__and were treated as equals g- - and - and help- - helpers you know in - in research uh uh c- - uh roles and things that they - that they ==__c8
__s^bk__in terms of like the s- - the social dynamics of interactions i would expect them to be less deferent .__c8
__s^cs__uhhuh .__c1
__fg|s^na__and um maybe less assertive of their own views and things like that .__c8
__b.%__i see .__c1
__b.%__i don't think that we're going to have a lot of undergrads .__c8
__s.%--__right .__c3
__s__unless we branch out to different types of meetings but ==__c8
__s^bk__how about - you could say if you're giving a talk how likely are you to be challenged ?__c4
__s^df__this is the dimension .__c8
__s__well this is the dimension .__c8
__b__well one of the - one of the criteria i had for designing this form is that i didn't want a separate instruction sheet .__c3
__s__yeah but - one - one dimension .__c8
__b__yeah .__c2
__b__and so we'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__b__is i did not want to have to you know come down and quiz each person and have a uh social dynamics expert being the one who's filling out the answers .__c3
__s^f__i want it to be self evaluating .__c3
__b__you can give it to them and they can understand what you're asking .__c3
__fg|qh^cs^tc.%--__uhhuh .__c8
__s^tc__and it's non threatening .__c8
__s^bk__i mean this - this compared to you know wh- - exactly what level of professorship and - and ==__c8
__%-__yep .__c3
__s__well sounds like you really need to know something kind of like that .__c4
__s__you need to know sort of bas- - in- - in this meeting sort of what is your social status .__c4
__s__that's a separate question .__c3
__s__so we'll - we'll get to that in a moment .__c3
__s__well i agree with him though .__c8
__fh|s__i ==__c8
__s__yeah .__c8
__s__but i - i agree that this is that w- - the rea- - the motivation was things that could affect social dynamics in ways that are relevant to the research without being threatening to the person .__c8
__s__but - but - but it's going to depend on who's ==__c4
__s__and this particular form ==__c3
__s__i know .__c3
__s__so this particular form is speaker - is dependent only on the speaker .__c3
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__not on the meeting .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__you could imagine then having another form that you might want to do during a meeting to get out the relationships .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__but then that's interfering with the meeting .__c3
__s__so what i like about this information is you give it to them once and they fill it out once .__c3
__s__and - and then you have that information .__c3
__s__well and we - also discussed the idea of having the separate d t d's would handle maybe s- - specific - meeting specific things that might be relevant .__c8
__s^df__i g- ==__c4
__s__i- ==__c1
__s^df__d t d ?__c1
__s__uh the data so that ==__c8
__s__you know his x m l thing ?__c8
__s__you got the data type definition - the document type definition p- - part that it's - can s- - be used for relational things .__c8
__fh|s__oh .__c1
__s__oh okay .__c1
__s^e__uh yeah .__c2
__h|s^e__yeah .__c2
__s__d t d .__c2
__s__yeah .__c8
__s^e__i guess - i guess it seems to me like you know i - trying to deduce information about the person's status from the meeting independent form will be useless because ==__c4
__s__see- ==__c1
__s__not at all .__c3
__s^e__i mean the fact that one person's an undergrad and the other's a full professor is interesting .__c3
__s__so the question is how much of this information um can y- ?==__c3
__s__but that will depend on what the meeting's about .__c4
__s__right ?__c4
__s^bk__well absolutely !__c3
__qo^rt^t^tc__let's say the undergrad was an expert in physics and ==__c4
__s^ar__but - but you want to have that information .__c3
__s^bk|s^co__@reject@ yeah .__c2
__s__right ?__c3
__fh__so if you don't have that information how are you going to do anything ?__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__i guess i'm wondering how can you make a conclusion based on that if you don't know about the meeting ?__c4
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__where'd - this is just - well you know we're - we're talking at - at a general level of description .__c8
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__you can always get more specific .__c8
__s^bk__and it may be ==__c8
__b__i mean so what would you suggest ?__c3
__s__i don't know .__c4
__s__i'm just - that's why i was wondering about if you can put something about the d- ==__c4
__s^bk__right .__c1
__s__@reject@ - can you repeat the categories you had ?__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__maybe they're fine .__c0
__s__undergrad grad post doc professor other .__c3
__qy^d^rt__so that yeah | i think that's fine except the one thing is there are a lot of icsi v- ==__c0
__s^bk__like i don't know what i would be here .__c0
__s__just - i'm not a professor .__c0
__s__i'm not a ==__c0
__b__so - so anything that like a visitor r- - icsi visitor or icsi y- ==__c0
__s__oh that's right .__c3
__s^ba^fe__you know i was saying professor ==__c3
__s^t^tc__i mean a visiting s- - researcher or whatever .__c0
__s^bu__uhhuh .__c3
__s^ar__yeah | when i said professor i guess what i was thinking in my mind was more p h d but not post doc .__c3
__s^ar__how about - yeah how about post p h d researcher or something ?__c1
__s^na__so if - if we can put something ==__c0
__qw^rt__and - or maybe post doc - change post doc to p h d ?__c3
__s__yeah that - then - then i think what you have is great .__c0
__s^e.%-__yeah .__c2
__%-__right ?__c1
__qy^bu^d__for - for that purpose and ==__c0
__s^nd__so change - would we change post doc to post p h d researcher ?__c8
__s__or just ==__c0
__s^df__you could say ==__c0
__s__because i think p h d and professor are d- - are distinct .__c3
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__aren't they ?__c3
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__wait | what's a p h d ?__c0
__fh__it's possible .__c2
__s__like if you have a p h d and you're hanging around here and you're not a professor and you're not a post doc then that's like what we are so there's a bunch of people like that .__c0
__s__someone who has a p h d .__c3
__s.%--__yeah | so for - for me there's - there's a - there are people ==__c1
__fh__um this got very tricky in fact when we got involved with the spanish program actually .__c1
__s^co.%--__because uh when we said in our original forms post doc what we were used to from the german program and from the u s standard when you say post doc it meant somebody who had just gotten a p h d who was doing one year someplace .__c1
__s^t1__yeah .__c2
__s^ba^t1__right .__c0
__s^co__but when we did the spanish call many people said oh i want to be uh - have a post doc slot and they were twenty years out .__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__yeah .__c2
__fh|s__right .__c0
__s^e__yeah .__c2
__s__because they were post their doc .__c1
__s__right .__c0
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__so you can say post p h d researcher or what- - if there's one more category that's sort of general like that .__c0
__s__so ==__c1
__s__sure .__c2
__s__i - i - i think that ==__c1
__s__right .__c2
__b__it might be hard to do a finer thing than that because whether somebody is going to be dominant in a meeting is really i think it's going to be so clouded by everything else .__c1
__fh|s^rt__someone who's just gotten their p h d uh could be very very uh strongly opinionated about something and somebody who's been twenty years out could be shy you know s- ==__c1
__s.%--__so maybe undergrad grad post p h d and other ?__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^df__that's true .__c8
__s__what's other ?__c1
__s__um other ==__c3
__s__for the european .__c4
__s__it's just to allow .__c8
__s__if i- - instead of - instead of - instead of professor or instead of post doc ?__c3
__s__you - i think you could keep professor but you could say post p h d researcher or something .__c0
__s__yep .__c2
__s__it could be st- - it could be - that's true .__c8
__s__no | instead of post - post doc or post p h d just wrap all the people that are post p h d and non professors together .__c0
__qw__so you want professor to be in a separate category .__c1
__s^rt__you think - you think uh - think - think we ==__c1
__s__so as i said undergrad ==__c3
__s^aa|s^m^na__i think professors probably want it .__c0
__fh__i don't care .__c0
__s^rt__undergrad grad post p h d professor other ?__c3
__s^rt__yeah .__c0
__s__well yeah the post p h d one is the one that can be like post- - post doc or post p h d researcher or whatever .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__right .__c3
__s.%--__then it'd be fine .__c0
__s.%--__i think it's fine .__c0
__s__so | i'm te- - i'm tending to push toward simpler .__c1
__s__even though i know that more detailed means more potential information for someone later who's doing research in - in this area .__c1
__s__i - uh - the - the - the thing making me lean toward simpler where possible is that uh the more a thing ==__c1
__s.%--__many of the meetings that we record uh may be the kind where we just record somebody once .__c1
__s^bd^df__even though we want to get a lot of data that has uh many meetings with the same people .__c1
__s__and so the more forms we have and the more lines in the forms that's th- - the more overhead for that one time thing makes it harder to do .__c1
__s__well the whole reason that i'm doing it this way is - is uh - my experience so far has been the exact reverse .__c3
__fh|s__that ==__c3
__s.%-__right | that's what we've done so far .__c1
__s^bk|s^co__right .__c3
__s^co__right ?__c1
__s__and so i'm saying i expect us to do both kinds .__c1
__s__i guess we could have another type of form for less frequent .__c3
__s__yeah .__c0
__s__well one thing so you understand he - he d- - he wants you to do this only once for each person ?__c8
__s__yes .__c1
__s^bk|s__okay okay .__c8
__s__so i'm saying there are going to be - what i imagine once we've collected a lot of data a chunk of it will be uh the same people many times .__c1
__b__so ==__c8
__qy^d^rt__and another chunk of it will be people - random meetings that we got with from different people .__c1
__s^bk|s__uhhuh .__c8
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c8
__b__yeah .__c2
__s^ft__uhhuh .__c8
__fg|s^t^tc__and i think it's use- - we've talked about this before it's useful to have both kinds of data i think .__c1
__s__well i think that if - if we're planning to do that then we should probably have another set of forms .__c3
__%-__okay .__c1
__s^ar|s^nd__you know a single form that's the consent form and the speaker information form and not have them do digits .__c3
__%-__okay .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__no i like the idea of putting down the - the status information .__c4
__s^bk|s^ba__because i think you probably can get a lot of interest- - there can be a lot of interesting research on that .__c4
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c8
__s^bk|s^na__uhhuh .__c2
__fg|s__i'm wondering could we add something to the form that gets filled out at each meeting that would somehow ?==__c4
__s^rt__this is a topic i want to bring up after i get through this .__c3
__s^rt__yeah .__c4
__s__okay .__c4
__s__so that - that - that's another form that i want to discuss um with the digits forms .__c3
__s__well - i guess i was thinking maybe you know how you were taking information off of the digits and putting it onto that ?__c4
__s__so s- - can we get ==__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^rt__could we put one more thing on here maybe ?__c4
__s:qw__that's what i want to talk about in a ==__c3
__s:s__yeah i'm - i have that as a topic also .__c3
__fh|s.%--__okay .__c4
__s__so let's finish with the speaker form - speaker form and then we'll get over o- - get over to that one .__c3
__s__because you said separate forms so i thought maybe ==__c4
__s.%--__okay .__c4
__s^ba__so education level undergrad grad post p h d professor other .__c3
__s__okay ?__c3
__s:qw__okay .__c2
__s__um | and then i put optional with a big optional in parentheses age .__c3
__s^e__wait why is that optional ?__c0
__s__because i think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down .__c3
__s__yeah .__c2
__s^e__so i don't want to make them feel like they have to .__c3
__s__yeah .__c8
__fh|s__i don't know .__c0
__fh|s:s__it - it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes .__c0
__qy^d^f^g__yeah .__c2
__s:s__i mean a lot of corpora ==__c0
__s__uh sure | but if someone doesn't want to write it down i don't want them to say you can't record me .__c3
__s__yeah | so we ca- - we have these age ranges or something ?__c0
__s__oh right .__c4
__s.%--__well it ==__c8
__fh__well wait - wait - wait - wait a minute .__c1
__s^rt__you know like ==__c0
__s.%--__um | it's not illegal or anything .__c1
__s__right ?__c1
__s__it's not pushing on anything unethical or illegal whatever to ask for their age .__c1
__s__no not at all .__c0
__s^rt__right ?__c1
__s^e__every - most corpora have that you know information .__c0
__b.%__so ==__c1
__qy^d^f^g__i suggest you ask for their age .__c1
__s^e__and if they say i don't want to give it say okay .__c1
__s__in - in like the london lund they - they - the researchers themselves estimate the age afterw- - after the fact .__c8
__s^rt:s^fe__yeah .__c2
__s__so they say you know uh middle thirties you know fifties or sixties .__c8
__s.%--__yeah .__c2
__s__and they - and they just - they estimate for the person but ==__c8
__s__well i think that just having on the form - saying optional age again means i don't have to be sitting here and explaining the form every time we do this .__c3
__s^e__yeah that's okay .__c0
__s__yeah .__c8
__s^rt__and it isn't - it isn't that boldf- ==__c8
__s^cc^rt__and having a little instruction sheet and say if you're in this age- - range do this and if you're in this rage do that .__c3
__s__i see .__c1
__s__yeah .__c8
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__and it's - and it isn't really that prominent .__c8
__s.%--__so ==__c3
__s__how about ?==__c4
__s__it's - you know his optional is not really boldface but ==__c8
__s^rt__how about optional but highly desirable ?__c4
__s__please please !__c8
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__age or approximate age .__c0
__s__so somebody can say thirties if they're thirty nine .__c0
__s__actually approximate ?__c8
__qw^br__o- - opt- - age is optional but those who don't give it will be given the uncomfortable microphones .__c1
__s__yeah right .__c3
__s^bk__that's right .__c8
__b__well those who don't give it we will be estimating your age for you .__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__yeah | if not given we will estimate .__c4
__s^ba^bd__so maybe you'll prefer to ==__c0
__s__i - i think is not ==__c2
__s__the - the mean of the estimates from the group will be used ==__c1
__fh|s__yeah .__c4
__s__i think it's not necessary to put uh optional .__c2
__qw__yeah | people can leave it blank if they ==__c0
__qy__i think people decide uh in that moment .__c2
__qy.%--__i - i think people in speech are going to want to ==__c0
__s__because if you put optional i think you - you give uh ==__c2
__s__they're very strong willed .__c4
__s__you know ?__c4
__s__people - he- ==__c4
__s__well i think maybe that's because no one here is sensitive about their age .__c3
__s.%--__they can always lie .__c0
__s__but i would rather let them leave it blank than lie .__c3
__s__okay | in some sense you could say that please leave blank but - but don't lie .__c0
__fh__so that's why i want to put - that's why i want to put s- - optional age .__c3
__s__so that if they don't want to put it they leave it blank .__c3
__s__they might lie anyway .__c1
__s__yeah .__c2
__s__but if you put optional won't they just leave it blank rather than lie ?__c3
__s__i don't know .__c1
__s__okay .__c3
__s^bd^df__i think - i think - you can put optional .__c4
__fh|s.%--__i mean - i mean the peop- - the people i've known who've lied about it i think would just lie about it .__c1
__qy^bu^d^rt__it's not going to ==__c4
__s^aa|s__right .__c0
__%--__you don't think they'd just leave it blank if it says - has a big optional right next to it ?__c3
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__s^df__you know people who lie about it ?__c4
__s__oh yeah .__c1
__s^bk|s^fa__well they might leave it blank if they didn't care about their age being known but it says optional they might not .__c0
__fg|s__hey | jack benny was thirty nine for forty years .__c1
__s^e__anyway | it's fine .__c0
__s^aa__i don't know .__c0
__s.%--__well the thing abou- - the reason uh one reason for putting optional might be if it uh made the form seem gentler and k- - and not as intrusive kind of thing .__c8
__fg|s__kinder and gentler .__c1
__s__yeah i noticed i was afraid you'd - i shouldn't say that .__c8
__s:s__yeah .__c2
__fh__they uh - that you know i- - if you say optional then it's sort of ==__c8
__s__if people who - get nervous about the age question then they realize that oh well but they're not trying to ask me lots of things .__c8
__s__yeah | i think it's okay .__c4
__s.%--__i don't think it matters .__c1
__s__people will put it i - i ==__c4
__qh__i - i don't think it matters .__c1
__qh__if it makes you more comfortable put optional .__c1
__qh^e__it - it - i think it's better to put optional .__c3
__s__i - i don't think it's ==__c1
__s^no__okay .__c0
__s.%--__i mean that's why i put it there s- ==__c3
__s__then ==__c1
__s__okay .__c4
__s__okay okay .__c2
__b__but it seems like maybe you disagree .__c3
__s.%-__i like it .__c8
__s^2__i think it's softening .__c8
__s^m^na__i - i - i don't think it's important but i also don't think it's an important point the other way .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__%--__and i don't want to make you do it some different way than you want to do it .__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__yeah it's okay .__c0
__b__so ==__c1
__s^bk__huh .__c2
__s__okay .__c8
__s^bd^df__as long as we put it high enough up that it doesn't sort of get lost in the optional if there are a lot of other optional things on the form .__c0
__s__well i didn't mark anything else as specifically optional .__c3
__s__that's - that's the only optional thing .__c0
__s__let's see .__c8
__s^bk__that's the only other one .__c8
__s__that's the only one .__c8
__s__okay .__c0
__s^aa__so ==__c3
__s__um | and then the next are two sections .__c3
__s__one indented separately .__c3
__s.%--__so one's for native english speakers and one for non native english speakers .__c3
__s^df__okay so for the native english speaker it asks for a variety of english with three circle boxes .__c3
__s.%--__american british indian and other for write in .__c3
__b__now what was this thing that ?==__c1
__s__who was telling ?==__c1
__s__was it steve ?__c1
__b__somebody was telling us about asking about uh ==__c1
__fh__where you lived between the ages of ==__c4
__s^bk__yep | jane and i discussed this and it was - it was again the same problem .__c3
__s^tc__that it's going to be a self evaluation anyway .__c3
__s__and so i don't want to have to be standing over the person and asking them well do you mean that your native an- - l- - an- - language was british when you were born and then it changed to american when you were two and then it changed to - and so on .__c3
__s__well also you - you - you - he has a sep- - separate subject for region .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c1
__s__and so it's a self assessment of what you think your closest variety is of english .__c8
__s^e__and then following that a characterization of - of region .__c8
__s__now we discussed maybe indicating a t- - a time frame .__c8
__s__so where did you live during your you know childhood and adolescence .__c8
__s__right .__c3
__fg|qh__uhhuh .__c4
__qy^d^f^g__which would be ==__c8
__qh__which is more objective than somebody evalu- - saying i think i speak this or that .__c4
__qh__yes uhhuh .__c8
__s__although you know i mean a lot of people there won't be e- - much difference .__c8
__s.%--__i mean th- - there's room on the form to put al- - a- - a line of instruction but i'm just not sure what it re- - should really be .__c3
__s__i - i - i'm sorry so you're saying ?==__c1
__qw__but ==__c8
__s^bu^e^rt__uhhuh .__c8
__s^ar__uh i - i - i just missed something though .__c1
__s^ar^r|s^df.%--__are you saying that you have both ?__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__s:s__that you're saying uh what is your ?==__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c8
__s^bu__so the - the for the non na- - for the native english speakers we have variety of english and region .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c1
__s^bk__and that's it .__c3
__s__and that's partly to pick up ==__c8
__s__and then we have another form later down which is um list other language influences .__c3
__s^aa__yeah .__c8
__s.%-__s- - uhhuh .__c8
__qy^bu^d^rt__so what does region mean ?__c0
__b__yeah | i was just going to ask the same thing .__c4
__s^aa__and like if i see this form i wouldn't be quite sure what you mean by region .__c0
__s__region ==__c4
__%-__right | neither would i .__c3
__s^am__do you want to have - give choices and have them circle one or ?==__c0
__%-__i mean ==__c0
__s^bk__well we - when we - when we discussed it it was - it was where - where you lived during your childhood and adolescence .__c8
__s__um i don't think we can do that because it would be different for ==__c3
__s__does that mean region of ?==__c4
__%-__region of the u s or region of the world ?==__c4
__s__if you're american english it would be region of the u s .__c3
__fg__well - it's - w- - it's where you lived .__c8
__s__okay .__c4
__s^bk__that - that - so that's why i didn't have circle forms .__c3
__s__but i mean ==__c0
__s^e__because it would be different depending on what your language is .__c3
__s__so ==__c3
__s__do you mean state or do you mean more broad than the state level ?__c4
__s__huh .__c1
__s__you mean like you know southern u s or northeastern or ?==__c4
__s__it- - i think it would be however you would identify your own .__c3
__s^e__and as i said i don't really see a way of doing a circle fill in because there would be - there would have to be one for american english one for british english one for you know one for each type .__c3
__s^aa__uhhuh .__c8
__qy^d^f^g__if you wanted to get regions for american english you could copy what they did in timit .__c4
__s__well and also ==__c8
__s__they had divided things up into regions .__c4
__s__but - but that would mean i would have to do - generate a different form for circles if you're american english or british english or indian english .__c3
__b__no no .__c4
__%-__it would only be f- - if you said american english .__c4
__s^bk__yeah | maybe not for the others because there aren't going to be enough people to really group them .__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__then you'd put the regions .__c4
__s^na|s^aa__for the others you would just leave it .__c4
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__s^df__we wouldn't have enough to really make them - difference on those .__c4
__s^bk__and you know when you talk about dialects in england i mean that's really ==__c0
__s.%--__well ==__c8
__s^bu|qy^d^g^rt__every block of london has a different ==__c0
__fg|s__huh .__c2
__fh__so ==__c0
__s^df__yeah .__c1
__s__i haven't seen what - what they did in timit .__c8
__s:qw__my fair lady's ==__c0
__s__are you s- - do they have a bunch of options like uh ?==__c8
__s^rt__oh it's like six regions of the country or something .__c4
__s__yeah .__c1
__s:qw__i see .__c8
__s:qw__very - just a limited number .__c4
__s.%--__okay .__c8
__s__and then if you're american you would just circle the region where ==__c4
__%--__yeah .__c1
__s.%--__well that's the concept .__c8
__%--__yeah .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s^f__yeah | and henry higgins could say which block you were from .__c1
__fh__well ==__c8
__s__right ?__c1
__s__yeah .__c4
__s.%--__so that's ==__c1
__b__that's right .__c8
__s^f^rt__well that - you know that was the concept of having the region thing .__c8
__s__i - it would be no problem to change it to options if um - if that were desirable .__c8
__s__yeah | i just don't know what to do about the other varieties of english .__c3
__b__although for different ==__c8
__s^e__well that's true .__c8
__s__you'd just leave them .__c4
__s__i mean indian english i wouldn't know f- ==__c8
__s^rt__you don't even ask .__c4
__s__i - i - there are huge differences you know in the others .__c0
__s^df__what ?==__c8
__s|qy^d^g__well that's why i wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down .__c3
__s:qw__so it might be better to just do it for the ==__c0
__s^df__yeah you could leave region for - for the others but have circled choice for the american english .__c0
__b__one - one good reason to use the timit ones is if anybody asks you you know about the data later on you can say well i chose these based on timit and ==__c4
__%__right .__c0
__s__that is kind of nice .__c8
__b__what ==__c1
__s^df:qw__what about just doing the - the sort of the steve suggestion uh as - as an add on to it ?__c1
__b__right ?__c1
__s^aa__rather than saying region just say where did you live between the ages of here and here .__c1
__b__that was the concept of region .__c8
__s^df^e__and that would apply to everybody then ?__c4
__b__yeah .__c4
__s^aa__just ==__c1
__s^aa__and - it's just the wording of it .__c8
__s__and then you could map those to the timit regions later if people wanted to .__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c2
__s__and then they - they could s- ==__c1
__b__right - yeah | they could say it different ways .__c1
__b__yeah .__c4
__fh__yeah .__c2
__fg__that's more general .__c4
__s.%--__they could say cincinnati or they could say midwest or ==__c1
__s^aa|s__yeah .__c4
__fg|s__that's true .__c4
__s__yeah .__c2
__s.%--__actually that is true for them .__c0
__s^f__but it means that you're going to get a bunch of different level - levels of resolution in your survey it - it'll be more of a pain later .__c0
__s^bu__so ==__c0
__s__somebody's going to have to do some data ==__c1
__s^e__well there could be a circle one .__c3
__fg|s__it depends .__c0
__s__i guess there's a- ==__c8
__s__right ?__c3
__b__so you could say what region did you grow up in from these years .__c3
__s__and have a set of circ- - of six or seven circles ==__c3
__s^no__yeah that - that's good .__c0
__b__but if you - have it totally free form first of all some people take - you ==__c0
__s__yeah .__c3
__s^e__a lot of post processing ?__c4
__s^bk__well and some people would give you more specific information than others .__c0
__s^bd__and that's a waste because you can only use the least common denominator of specificity and generally .__c0
__b__yeah but that - but the good thing about it is it - is it frees you from coming up with exactly what the right categories are .__c1
__s^cs__um | right ?__c1
__s^bk__i don't know .__c0
__s__later on if - if somebody just says midwest now all these other people who said you know area- - then that'll have to become your category .__c0
__s^df__yeah .__c1
__s__and it's - it's harder later on i- - i - it's easier for the person .__c0
__s__i see .__c1
__s__there is another problem .__c8
__s.%--__but it's harder for the r- ==__c0
__s^bd^df__it actually less informative for us .__c0
__s^rt__because you can't enforce any minimum level of specificity .__c0
__s.%--__but i think that if you're going to have it be general uh ==__c1
__s__so it's ==__c0
__s__so the idea again was you know you might want to also know if - if they grew up in germany or if they grew up ==__c1
__s:s^bk__and so uh i think you want to - the idea - the motivation i think for this being suggested before was that it did cover a range of these cases that might um ==__c1
__s^e:s__you know if you say your native language was - was english but uh you you grew up in germany uh i think this ==__c1
__s__yeah | y- - there is actu - you made me think about another wrinkle in this whole thing which is that just asking them where they grew up between certain ages isn't enough .__c4
__s__because somebody could grow up in germany but live on an army base speaking english .__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__qh__yeah .__c8
__s__or someone could in geor- - in - in new york and have i mean any number of different types of speech patterns .__c8
__s__or their parents live ==__c0
__s.%--__yeah .__c0
__fh__yeah | so you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of ==__c4
__s^2^cs__and their parents ==__c0
__s^aa|s__well we have this - we have to ==__c8
__s^bsc__so he hasn't given you the overview .__c8
__s__but you have like the native speaker category the non native speaker category .__c8
__s__and then you have other language influences for example bilingual dialects th- - things like that .__c8
__s__oh that's nice okay .__c4
__qh__now there's this issue of not wa- - like you're saying you don't want the forms to be hugely complicated and take half the meeting to complete .__c8
__s^no^rt__uhhuh .__c4
__b__so it's trying to - e- - there's this - trying to - trying to hold this balance between the amount of information needed .__c8
__s.%-__and uh you know not taking too much meeting time .__c8
__s^co__and then in addition add to it the third level of the balance uh um this - this issue of not being too intrusive asking in a way that they don't mind .__c8
__%-__uhhuh .__c4
__s__if we release this corpus what do we want ?__c0
__qy^rt__i mean if you do this free form um the free form solution where some questions are very open ended then you need - someone needs to enter that .__c0
__s^aa__and they'll be notes and it will be very difficult for somebody later actually use that without mapping it .__c0
__s^df__well i think rea- - i think that we need to remember that we have - first of all it's not all free form .__c8
__fh__it's okay .__c0
__s.%--__but it's ==__c0
__qy^rt__we have several categories that are specifically constrained .__c8
__s^e^rt__uhhuh .__c0
__qy^bu.%--__and in terms of the more open ones we have the - we're in the enviable position of having the contact information and also knowing most of the people who will be participating in the meeting data .__c8
__qy^bu^d^rt__we can find it - we can resolve certain issues later if ==__c8
__qrr__huh .__c0
__s.%-__yeah | and the question is how extensive this gets ?__c1
__s__i mean i guess what you really want is if there's some information you want to know ==__c0
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__s.%-__so we want some rough idea of their dialect basically .__c0
__s^bk|s^2__that's it .__c8
__s^m^na__then we should have some question where it's not free form except for these people who are - who have non american english accents .__c0
__s^bk__there we probably have to have a category non american english and then a few choices .__c0
__s__and we should have something that's simple that people can circle like these timit regions or something so that we have something that minimally you can ==__c0
__s^bk__because a lot of times if you give the data out that's what people are going to use .__c0
__s^bk__they're going to want some small set of places .__c0
__s^bu__and then but anything additional people can fill out and we can put it in as a note or something .__c0
__%-__but if we don't have that someone's got to sit there and figure out you know i've got twenty people who said midwest .__c0
__s^ar__and i've got a few people who said something else .__c0
__%-__and these don't overlap or these ==__c0
__s^bk__well- - isn't it - i mean i think that we're going a little bit in a circle because i like the timit suggestion very much .__c8
__s^ar__and i think it's a question of how to ge- - incorporate it .__c8
__s.%-__and - and we've already suggested - i mean it's come up in this discussion that - the suggestion that we could have um the timit categories for the american .__c8
__%-__and - and then make the choice or not as to whether we do it for british .__c8
__s^cs__oh okay | so ==__c0
__qy.%--__yeah as long as you have ==__c0
__%-__i mean w- - we sort of discussed one way or the other .__c8
__s^bk__and it doesn't matter to me .__c8
__fh__i don't know if adam has - has a preference .__c8
__s^nd__but - but ==__c1
__s__but we could have you know a sub- - a sub categorization for american .__c8
__b__we could even use the timit subcategorization .__c8
__b__i don't know if it has one for british or whatever .__c8
__b__uhhuh .__c4
__s__but you know just have it - you know a short simple form that you can categorize yourself in a - in a systematic way .__c8
__b__what about the - the phrasing that um chuck used uh which was in - in relation to the question i was trying to formulate of uh where - where did you - what ?==__c1
__s__what was that - what w- - how did you phrase it ?__c1
__b__what language was spoken in the home .__c3
__s.%--__what language was spok- ==__c1
__qh^df__yeah so it's not where did you grow up but what language was spoken in the home between the ages of what would it be five and twelve or something like that ?__c1
__s.%--__huh .__c2
__s^rt__yeah .__c2
__b__it's a good idea .__c8
__s.%--__depends of who you ask what the age range is .__c3
__s^aa__well in the home the influence of the home is much lower age than that .__c0
__b__yeah .__c2
__qy^d^f^g__i mean once you go beyond the age five or six then it's the - the school influence as well and - and ==__c0
__s__and the peers .__c8
__b__yeah .__c0
__s.%--__so in the home it's sort of your phonetic first level .__c0
__s^df__that's one part though .__c8
__s:s__um a- - so it's - you know it starts to get sort of complicated .__c0
__b__yeah so this is why i ==__c3
__s.%-__well - it's - that's not a problem though .__c8
__s__so - so th- ==__c3
__qy^d^f^g__i mean that would be a good question to ask .__c8
__s.%-__and then you could add a question .__c8
__%-__you know would - uh among your peers .__c8
__s^aa__you know .__c8
__%__because he does make a good point about the region .__c1
__s__specify the age range .__c8
__qy^bu^d^rt__not necessarily again if you're on the army base or ==__c1
__s__right .__c0
__s^bk__well the way it's phrased right now it's clearly asking about language .__c3
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__and so what it's trying to get at is what you think you speak .__c3
__s.%-__now i think that the point is well taken that sometimes people are wrong about what they think they speak .__c3
__b__right .__c0
__s__but other than having a trained linguist interview them and ask these very specific questions i don't see a way around it .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c4
__b__because as you said what you're going to have to stay - say is well list the languages that your parents spoke when you were in home and how good they were at it and how long they spoke it .__c3
__b__and now list the ones in preschool .__c3
__s^2|s^aa__and now list the ones in first grade .__c3
__fg|s__and now list the ones your friends speak ==__c3
__%__sort of like as soon as you get to the cases on the edge the complexity just shoots up .__c4
__s__yeah that's right .__c8
__s__right .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c0
__s__so i want to try to keep the complexity so someone can fill out this form at the beginning of a meeting without taking f- - uh forty five minutes .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__and we're ==__c8
__s^ba__and then we - like i said we have the enviable benefit of knowing most of these people .__c8
__s.%--__and being able to ask them follow ups if we need to .__c8
__s__for now .__c1
__fh__right ?__c1
__s.%--__so it's - i mean again we are hoping to expand this out .__c1
__fh__for now .__c8
__s.%--__that's true .__c8
__fh__washington and stuff yeah .__c8
__s^no__yeah .__c1
__qy^rt__that's true .__c8
__s.%-__so i think that adding the - the timit categories is a good idea .__c3
__s^ar__because that's very easy for a person to fill out .__c3
__%--__but i think we still have this problem of is it going to be a self evaluation ?__c3
__s^ar^r__or are we going to ask them what was it when you were four years old or what was it when you were six years old or what wher- - w- ?==__c3
__s^bk__what's the best way of phrasing the question ?__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__well you know | the other thing too is that it seems like th- - one of the reasons you would gather real detailed information about their native language is if you were going to do fine grained phonetic analysis or something .__c4
__h__and - i don't ==__c4
__s^ar|%--__well it's ==__c8
__s^aap__and somebody might .__c1
__s__or adapta- - or adaptation .__c3
__s__most of - but most of those people don't rely on the self evaluations anyway .__c0
__b__well that's what i was going to ask .__c4
__s^bk__is that ?==__c4
__qy.%--__they'll probably listen to the speech .__c0
__s^no__so ==__c0
__s^e__well i - you know i w- - i was thinking of it as - e- ==__c8
__s__that's a good point .__c8
__b__but i was thinking uh you know with reference to the language model issue which uh ==__c8
__s.%--__and i guess it could be done inductively .__c8
__s__but if you have a bunch of say r less dialects and uh you know if they ==__c8
__s__but even you know in switchboard i - i remember looking really carefully at ==__c0
__fh|s.%--__they have information sort of like timit .__c0
__s^aa__i don't know it's - how well they categorized .__c0
__s^df__but they had north atlantic mid atlantic and ==__c0
__s__you know texas was definitely out on ==__c0
__b__i mean most of the people from cer- - certain places in the south were from specific texas locations .__c0
__s__but other than that you had a huge range of ==__c0
__b__you know people would say boston and they had nothing like what i would call a boston accent .__c0
__b__uhhuh .__c8
__s^e__so it was ==__c0
__s^e__interesting .__c8
__fh__were they putting down where they lived at the moment they m- - recordings were made ?__c4
__s__is that why ?__c4
__b__um | no the question was really geared towards trying to get people's self evaluation of their dialect region .__c0
__s__rather than where they grew up ?__c4
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__s__huh .__c4
__b__but you have a lot of stratification in - any region .__c8
__b__and you know for instance you know minnesota midwest is totally different than michigan midwest which is totally ==__c0
__s__yeah .__c4
__b__right .__c1
__s__interesting .__c8
__b__these were all settled by very different type people .__c0
__s__so it - it's sort of a general help .__c0
__s__but i think that anyone who's doing phonetics wouldn't rely on that they would probably use it as a first pass or something .__c0
__qh__so then we probably don't need the fine grained information .__c4
__s^rt__well maybe should we just ==__c3
__s__then maybe we shouldn't - just shouldn't ask .__c3
__b.%__well i think we do need to make sure about the f- - the non native accents because those are you know ==__c0
__b__yeah .__c4
__s__but we don't need to ha- - be really really specific about the others because it won't be very w- - helpful anyway .__c0
__qw__uhhuh .__c4
__qy^e__well maybe for the native english speakers we shouldn't even ask the region if it's that unreliable .__c3
__s^bu^e__i think we should because other databases do .__c0
__s^bk__it's sort of a political thing .__c0
__s__and there are some general ==__c0
__s^rt__like you will find more new yorkers in the new york category .__c0
__s.%--__but it's not ==__c0
__s__it can't be relied on only .__c4
__s__right .__c0
__fh__the other thing also is that i'm asking for the variety of english and i did just put american british indian and other .__c3
__s__so i didn't put canadian australian and all the other varieties .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c8
__s__but other is there and people will fill that out .__c0
__s__e- - but do you think those three are okay ?__c3
__s__they'll see by example .__c0
__s__yeah | that's - i think that's fine .__c0
__s__yeah | i think those are good .__c4
__s__okay .__c3
__s__they'll say oh i'm not one of these .__c0
__s__i'm canadian or ==__c0
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__so internally we have texas and other .__c1
__s.%--__huh .__c2
__s__so that for the eng- - native english speakers we'll do variety of english regions from the timit labels and another field .__c3
__s^rt__right .__c0
__qy^bu^d__i mean even like cal- - l a is totally different than ==__c0
__%-__and then ==__c3
__s^e__i mean you really can't um ==__c0
__s^ng__well ==__c8
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c8
__s.%--__we could ask them for more information but i don't think it's - necessary and it's not going to solve this problem .__c0
__s__i thought this was be fast .__c3
__s^co__yeah .__c4
__s^rt__well that's what the final - the fin- - the third category was designed to do .__c8
__s|qy^d^f^g__because - i mean you have a bunch of different types of accents in new york .__c8
__s__you know .__c8
__s__native speaking new yorkers as a - as a function of their social uh groups and their ethnic identifications and their - you know .__c8
__s__oh yeah .__c0
__s^rt__uhhuh .__c1
__s__there are lots of things that are very identifiable as um you know other - other aspects which is why we have this third category .__c8
__fg|s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__so we wanted to certainly distinguish american versus british and other types at that level .__c8
__s__and then allow people to self identify if there are other specific things .__c8
__s^rt__and then in addition this issue of regions with some sort of time frame for the re- - region because i think that if you live in massachusetts now versus you know in childhood and as- - adolescence ==__c8
__s:qw__so if you lis- - if - if you ==__c8
__s__air conditioning .__c3
__s.%--__you know .__c8
__qy^rt__so region with respect to a time frame is what i would suggest .__c8
__s__where did you live .__c8
__s__i mean what you said .__c8
__fh__you know where - where - wh- - where did you live .__c8
__s.%-__or uh what you were saying languages in the home .__c8
__s^aa__but i think that uh a time frame on the region would be useful .__c8
__s__instead of region now say it's a little bit unbounded .__c8
__qy^bu^d^rt__um | so are you suggesting that you put something in about childhood in there ?__c1
__s.%-__well you know there's this issue of - of what age is relevant for the formation of your speech patterns whatever they are .__c8
__s^arp__well you could distinguish between pre five and five t- - five to twelve .__c1
__%-__and - oh that's interesting .__c8
__s^bk|s^bk^m__right ?__c1
__s^bk__so depending on what someone's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of categories or whether - or whether you're talking more about their linguistic speech patterns .__c1
__s^na^r__you know uh ==__c1
__s__so ==__c1
__s^bk__but again it depends how fine we want to get .__c1
__%-__but we could say uh where did you live before you were five .__c1
__s.%--__where did you live after you were five .__c1
__%__i don't know .__c1
__s.%--__oh that's interesting .__c8
__s^no__from five to - fifteen or something is a ==__c8
__s__yeah .__c1
__s^bk__i mean i think the question on regions is really to ask people how did they define their dialect region now .__c0
__s^e__di- ==__c0
__%-__the- - whether they picked it up at - the - one age or another .__c0
__qy^d^f^g__pretty much i mean most people will know whether they have a southern accent or not .__c0
__s^df__uhhuh .__c8
__s.%--__um | but they may have lived you know in other places too .__c0
__s__so if we ask the question about dialect regions it makes no sense to say where do you live now .__c0
__s__right .__c3
__s__right ?__c0
__b__you ask how would you best define your - your accent or your dialect style .__c0
__s__right .__c1
__b__right | the way - the way the form reads now i think it's pretty clear that's what we're asking because it says native english speakers variety of english american british indian other region .__c3
__s^df__okay .__c0
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c8
__s__and then we'll have southern english you know whatever - whatever the timit categories are .__c3
__b__so i think i- - if you look at this fr- ==__c3
__s__or you could say to somebody how do you define your - your - the accent that you have .__c0
__s^rt__right .__c3
__s__um | and then you can ask these other questions as well .__c0
__b__but what we don't want them to think is that they're living in a certain place .__c0
__s__and that therefore they're ==__c0
__b__i mean nowadays hardly anybody from california has a native californian accent .__c0
__s^bu.%--__right .__c1
__s^rt__yeah .__c8
__qy^rt__well | i - i g- ==__c8
__qrr.%--__okay .__c8
__qw__so ==__c0
__%--__i don't think it was ever the intent to talk about the region now .__c8
__qh^bu^rt__because ==__c8
__qrr.%--__right | so i - it seems to me that if you read this form i w- - it's pretty obvious that it's a subcategory of the language that you think you speak .__c3
__s__okay .__c0
__s.%-__it's - it's a sub categorization .__c8
__s^bk|s__as long as it's clear .__c0
__s^aa|s__uhhuh .__c8
__s__not where you live .__c3
__b__i mean i don't say anything about where you live on the form .__c3
__b__okay .__c0
__s^rt__yeah .__c8
__s__okay .__c0
__s__okay .__c1
__b__so it's just in the section talking about language .__c3
__fh__okay .__c0
__b.%__why don't we try it out and see - see what kind of responses we get from people .__c1
__s__yeah .__c3
__s__yeah .__c0
__fh__anyway ==__c1
__s.%--__and then uh as jane said the last question is list other language influences bilingual dialects et cetera .__c3
__qy^bu^rt__and that's just and open ended place for them to do .__c3
__s^bu^e__oh .__c0
__s^aa|s.%--__uhhuh .__c0
__s__sounds good .__c0
__s__that's to handle that unusual percent or two .__c8
__b__and then ==__c3
__b__yeah .__c8
__fg|s__and then the bottom of the form is for - not for them to fill out but for us to fill out for um the aliases and database - speaker database that the person is in since we'll eventually anonymize .__c3
__qy^d^f^g__and this will be a form- - a place for us to connect the two .__c3
__fh__and then the meetings that they attended .__c3
__qy^d^f^g__uhhuh .__c0
__s__because there'll be one form for each person .__c3
__b__sounds good .__c0
__s__it's very efficient .__c8
__s__okay so ==__c3
__s__yeah i guess i'll fiddle around yet again with the language stuff .__c3
__s__i don't think you really have to do all that much .__c4
__qy^bu^d^rt__d- - i- ==__c1
__s^e^rt__yeah .__c1
__qy.%-__it - it gets into a can of worms .__c0
__s^bk|s__well you ==__c8
__qy^bu^d__uhhuh .__c8
__s^bk__i mean the more you ask the more you realize that you're not getting great answers to what you're asking and ==__c0
__s^aa__yeah .__c4
__s^bk__n- - right yeah .__c4
__qy.%-__well y- - you didn't really talk about the non english speaker categories .__c8
__s__so ==__c0
__s__right .__c3
__%-__so there's another area which is non native english speakers which asks for native language region and variety of english .__c3
__qy.%-__and that's it .__c3
__s__because it used to be that germans would learn british english and now i think there's you know is a certain percentage of them who - who've @reject@ to tend toward american english .__c8
__s^m|s^bk__n- - detec- ==__c4
__s^bk__what about proficiency in english as well ?__c0
__s^bk|s__proficiency .__c3
__s__that's a good idea .__c3
__s^bk__uh | i ==__c1
__fg|s__that's hard though for self identification ==__c8
__s__i ==__c0
__s__you don't want to do it for political reasons ?__c0
__s__huh .__c2
__s.%--__i mean - i'm no- - i wasn't thinking about that .__c0
__fh__i was just thinking gee i'd like to know actually ==__c0
__fg|s__i wasn't thinking ==__c1
__b__oh no no .__c1
__s__i wasn't thinking political at all .__c1
__b__oh okay .__c0
__b__i was just saying looking at applications of people over the years for post docs here .__c1
__s__they're r- - generally not very good at assessing their own abilities .__c1
__s^bk__well do you think that's - that's also because they know that it's a re- - important for them to be good at it .__c3
__s^df__but ==__c1
__s__okay .__c0
__s__i agree .__c8
__s.%-__that could be .__c1
__fg|s^na__so don't - don't you think they overrate rather than underrate ?__c3
__qy__that could be .__c1
__qy.%-__yes .__c1
__s^na.%-__well so maybe that's ==__c0
__s^aa|s^df^no__so - but ==__c3
__s.%-__no i think proficiency is actually a good thing to have on this sort of form .__c3
__s^aa__maybe we - maybe we shouldn't ask it .__c0
__%--__the - the question are - what are - what would the categories be ?__c3
__b__i don't know .__c0
__s^bk__well e- - i'd ==__c8
__s^ba__i'd have to - i - i'd want to relate it back to training .__c8
__b__good .__c1
__s^bk__bad .__c1
__s__how many years did you study english .__c8
__b__or you know have you lived in the america - in a c- - an english country before .__c8
__b__but it seems like that's so ==__c8
__fh__i mean i think that you know if a person who ==__c8
__s^t^tc__what about something like how comfortable are you in a meeting conducted in english ?__c0
__s^e__or how easy is it for you ?__c0
__s^e__or something like that where it's ==__c0
__s__how b- - how - about how long have you been uh in - in an english speaking country ?__c1
__fh__yeah | that's a good one .__c0
__qh__yeah .__c2
__s__that'd be okay .__c8
__qw^rt__yeah .__c2
__qy^bu.%-__something ==__c0
__s^2__wha- - what do you think ?__c0
__s.%-__what's it ?==__c0
__s^aa|%__is better .__c2
__s^co__i mean ==__c0
__%-__i think it's better .__c2
__s^bk__how ?==__c0
__s__yeah ?__c0
__s^f__how long have you been in an english speaking country .__c0
__s__@reject@ yeah .__c2
__s__okay .__c0
__s__yeah i like that .__c8
__b__i like that .__c8
__s__that's - that's non threatening and it's also an i- - a good indicator .__c8
__b__yeah .__c1
__s__and there are people who haven't ever lived in an english speaking country and who are superb .__c8
__b__however um that's - you know i do think it's a pretty good indicator .__c8
__b__huh .__c2
__b__and | then there will be people who live in an english speaking country but all their meetings are held in another language .__c4
__s.%--__that's true too .__c8
__s^bk|s__or | even you know i mean some people who just don't change much in their ==__c8
__s^ng__so ==__c4
__s^df__yeah .__c2
__%-__yeah | i'm - i don't know .__c3
__qy^bu^d^rt__yeah .__c2
__s^aa|qh^e__yochai's company is like that .__c4
__%-__being totally monolingual i'm not the right person to ask to talk about this .__c3
__s^ba__everybody speaks hebrew .__c4
__s^aa|s^df.%-__really ?__c1
__s^aa__but it just seems to me that that doesn't - the length of time doesn't really get at what we're asking .__c3
__fg__right ?__c3
__%-__it seems to be that asking about the proficiency even if it's self rated is what we want to know .__c3
__%-__except that you have some many biasing factors .__c8
__s^bu__yeah .__c1
__s^aa__you have - you have people who are highly confident when they really should be a little bit less confident .__c8
__s^e.%--__and then you have uh other people who are just the reverse and - and it ==__c8
__s^aa__yes .__c1
__qh__so many things that vary - i ==__c8
__s^e__and also we want to keep it simple and non evaluative .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__s__okay .__c3
__s:s__we done ?__c1
__s:s^fe__with that form .__c3
__s__yeah .__c1
__b__oh there's another form .__c1
__s__shall we wait for other forms later or you - keep going more form ?==__c3
__s__no | you got - what's the other form ?__c1
__b.%__uh the other form is a modified digits form .__c3
__qw__uh and | it's pretty sim- - this one's pretty simple .__c3
__qw^e.%-__it's - it's very much what like the digits forms in front of us except it doesn't ha- - ask for sex or native language .__c3
__s^bk|s.%--__um so it's name email time date seat session mike number channel mike type .__c3
__fh|qy__why do we need that much information ?__c8
__s^e__why do we need the email address for example ?__c8
__s^bk__uh in case people have the same name .__c3
__s^ar|s^nd__oh i see .__c8
__s^bk__how often would that happen ?__c8
__fg|s^co__in case people what ?__c1
__s^bk|s__so i wanted ==__c3
__s__have the same name .__c3
__s__oh .__c1
__s^df.%--__yeah i'm particularly sensitive to this because a good friend of mine in s- - in seattle was named scott smith and there were fourteen of them in - at boeing .__c3
__s__i see .__c8
__%--__so we could drop email .__c3
__s__so the only - so ==__c8
__s__i mean that's not a big deal .__c3
__s^df__it's just uh ==__c3
__s__well it's an - it's an interesting identifier i - i - now that i realize the und- - the reason for it .__c8
__s.%--__the - that's true too .__c8
__s^f__well the other thing is that potentially if this is done over a period of time someone's email could change .__c1
__s__right .__c3
__s.%--:s__well the other way i was thinking about it was assigning them an i d .__c3
__s__yeah .__c8
__s__but i hate it when people do that to me .__c3
__s__when they say here's you i d .__c3
__fh__don't forget it .__c3
__s__oh yeah | that's bad .__c1
__s^df__so i - i wanted just something that would give us a hint of who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it's a duplicate .__c3
__s^df^no__thanks .__c1
__s__that's interesting .__c8
__s__how about their birthday ?__c0
__s^e.%--__good idea .__c8
__%__i don't know .__c0
__s__i mean not not - the year not the year .__c0
__%-__it's the age question again .__c8
__s__your mother's maiden name - mother's maiden name .__c3
__s__oh i see .__c1
__s__then you don't have to ask the age .__c1
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__not the year but just their birthday .__c0
__s__not the year .__c2
__s__i don't know .__c0
__b__what are the chances of people having the same name ?__c0
__s__social security number .__c3
__s__yeah that's right .__c8
__s__and a bank where you frequent ==__c8
__s^e__yeah .__c8
__fh|s__pin .__c4
__fh|s__they ==__c0
__s__social - social security number .__c1
__fh__the pin !__c2
__qy^bu^d^rt__so although the email - email will change i think that's a good way of doing it .__c3
__qrr__yeah .__c8
__s^ar|s__we'll be able to backtrack from email .__c3
__s__i like that .__c8
__s__i never thought of that as an identifier .__c8
__b__that makes sense .__c8
__b__um and then the other thing i was thinking about and it probably wouldn't be on the digits form .__c3
__s^no.%--__but it - it is something that some form about the individual meeting .__c3
__%__yeah .__c8
__s__now the problem i have with that is i don't know who would be filling it out .__c3
__b__well that i think someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact .__c8
__s__and this would - and - and we discussed this .__c8
__s^bd__this is with reference to like the d t d .__c8
__s^no__what you would put in the d t d that's meeting specific ?__c8
__s__so - and it could be something like oh by the way the guy giving the presentation today is the student of the professor who you know ==__c8
__fh__whatever .__c8
__s__so speaker a is his professor and they - and he's preparing for his quals or some such thing like that .__c8
__s^aa__or it could be you know so-and-so and so-and-so are married .__c8
__s^ba__huh .__c2
__s^ba__just to pick up an arbitrary an example .__c3
__b__so-and-so and so ==__c2
__s__we - this wouldn't be relevant all the time .__c8
__s__but you know if there's a big discussion on you know the - the - um best way to move house then - and these people are talking a whole lot then it might be interesting information to say oh by the way they're married or ==__c8
__s__i - i don't mean uh you know .__c8
__s^no__right .__c3
__b__so th- - so the sorts of questions i had were one who's going to fill it out and who's going to take responsibility for filling it out in each meeting ?__c3
__fh__i mean will we re- - will we require it ?__c3
__s^aa|s^na__i would tend to leave that e- - spontaneous .__c8
__%-__i think that e- - at the stage of uh uh sc- - scanning the transcripts after they've been produced by - by our - by i b m at that point i think that some of these dynamics will appear to be important .__c8
__s^bk__uhhuh .__c3
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c3
__s__and you could - you could spend a lot of time enumerating all the different relationships that people have .__c8
__s__and that was my other question which is um what sort of information do we want to record ?__c3
__s.x__yeah .__c8
__s.x__i mean so i think pairwise relationships are pretty easy .__c3
__b__uhhuh .__c8
__fg__you know source destination relation .__c3
__s__are there other sorts of things that might - we might want to record ?__c3
__b__well i ju- - i was just thinking with reference to uh things that have - that bear on the content or the status relations would be the things ==__c8
__fg|s__without being exhaustive by any means .__c8
__s__but just like i said if there's a k- - a certain topic that comes up in the meeting and - that knowing their relationship will clarify it or if there's a certain dynamic that comes up ==__c8
__qh^df__so i mean a person is asked a whole bunch of questions more than you'd usually think they'd be asked .__c8
__qy^d^f^g__and it turns out it's because he's being prepared for a job interview or something like that then it's useful to know that - that relationship .__c8
__s__right .__c3
__s__i think that fits in well with the whole meeting map - mapping meetings concept is that's another way of looking at - looking at it .__c3
__s__but not to be exhaustive .__c8
__fh__interesting .__c8
__s__so are there anything other than pairwise ?__c3
__s__oh well yeah | you could have people who are all part of the same football league or - uh or chess club or ==__c8
__s^e__oh yeah okay .__c3
__s^e.%--__so thi- - isn't this an open ended like basically a notes column ?__c0
__s^e__i mean you can imagine wanting you should be able always to attach some notes to ==__c0
__%--__yes shirt certainly .__c3
__s__is this the - the place where we would do that or is there another place ?__c0
__s__i've been thi- - i - it seems to be that there is - we could attach more structure if we wanted to .__c3
__s^e__especially because a lot of these relationships are pairwise power relationships .__c3
__s.%-__i- - maybe i was missing something maybe .__c1
__b__but i mean this is something one would try to infer .__c1
__fg|s^rt__but how do - how would you - how would you freeze that information about what uh ?==__c1
__s__i mean we already have these things about someone's a professor and someone's a student or something .__c1
__s^na|s^aa__but would you - would you - some person would be writing okay this person was leading the meeting and that was or - or ==__c1
__%-__uhhuh .__c8
__%--__is that what you mean or ?==__c1
__fh__what - what - what - uh ?==__c1
__s__um just as an example it would be source adam janin destination morgan relationship advisor .__c3
__s__oh | so you're just putting preexisting relationships that are ==__c1
__qy^rt__that are relevant .__c3
__s^aa__i think that starts to - there's definitely some clear cases .__c0
__s^aa__i see .__c1
__s^na__but there are a lot of gray areas where the context happens just in that meeting .__c0
__s.%--__yeah .__c1
__s.%-__yep .__c3
__s^rt__or ==__c0
__s^ar__i mean where you don't want to sort of have to make a distinction between a pre existing relationship or ==__c0
__%--__yeah i m- ==__c1
__%--__well realize w- - this was - the idea was that this would be meeting specific .__c8
__s.%--__otherwise they would - it would be possible to have a higher level thing .__c8
__b__but i mean there are some that generalize over many meetings and there are some that don't and there are some things that happen in between meetings .__c0
__s__right | but that example was not ==__c1
__s__that's true that's true .__c8
__s.%--__right | so my example was not a good one because that's ==__c3
__b.%__yeah .__c1
__s__so | i mean for - today for instance .__c1
__s__and ==__c0
__s__this is the second meeting recorded today .__c1
__s__the first meeting was a - was a front end meeting .__c1
__s^cs__and in that one the basic form of that was uh i was the leader .__c1
__b__and i was saying uh what are the results you've gotten in the last week .__c1
__s^na|s^nd__and they were - and uh one person was sort of taking the lead in describing what the results were .__c1
__s^df__and then uh chuck was taking the role of saying well what did you mean by that .__c1
__s^ar|s.%-__so he was sort of like the out- - s- - semi outsider asking curiosity questions .__c1
__s^df^e__and then it would come back to me with saying well you know you showed me that but you know i think you should do this in the future .__c1
__%--__so it was very much sort of leader and - and - and - and led sort of relationship .__c1
__s^df.%-__and um the guy i was primarily doing this with uh is - is a visiting researcher uh in this l- - meeting uh you are my graduate student .__c1
__s^am__but uh it's not taking that kind of role at all .__c1
__fg|s__right ?__c1
__s__right .__c3
__s__you're - you're - you're actually leading the meeting for the most part most of this meeting .__c1
__s.x__well it's just because it's my turn .__c3
__s__so it's ==__c1
__b__yeah | well whatever .__c1
__fh__so uh yeah | so i - i don't know .__c1
__fh__so you're suggesting ==__c1
__s__i think this one needs to be open ended .__c0
__%__completely open ended .__c0
__qw__and the only concern i would have is if there's something we want to be able to say and we can't put it in that field .__c0
__qy^bu^d^rt__well the- - there's - @reject@ i mean .__c8
__qw^br__i - g- - you - you're the expert on the d t d's .__c8
__s^r^rt__well the d t d's mean we can do whatever - however we want it .__c3
__s^aa|s__but ==__c8
__s^ar.%__yeah .__c8
__s^e__but what i - what i was thinking uh - the reason that i didn't want to make it completely open ended is that it does seems like there is some structure which is common .__c3
__s^bk__especially with these pairwise ones where you can describe them and pairwise .__c3
__s__so you mean like ==__c0
__s__and you might want a tool that used that information .__c3
__s__is there a way that we can add keywords or sub- ?==__c0
__s__i don't know what you would call them but little labels for things that we decide are useful things to have ?__c0
__s.%-__sure absolutely .__c3
__fg|%--__but you know as long as we have this one place where it can all be stored then we're fine i think .__c0
__fh__right | because it seems like it's sort of a ==__c1
__s^df__and those will probably occur - i mean to us we'll think of a few of them some other researcher will think of some totally different keyword .__c0
__s^bk|s__right .__c3
__s.%-__exactly .__c1
__s__it's sort of a research question you - you're analyzing the meeting and you're deciding uh there's this kind of structure to it .__c1
__b__y- - yeah it's - it's - it's going to change .__c0
__b__yeah .__c1
__s^cs.x__it's going to change .__c0
__s^e__yeah .__c2
__s^aap^cs.x__and maybe we want to regroup things under different labels later ==__c0
__s^aa.%__interesting .__c2
__s^no__if we figure out that these pairwise things are ==__c0
__s^aa|s^cs__right well | i think - being - being in a common organization was one i hadn't thought of that ==__c3
__%-__well ==__c8
__b__so you're football league was a good one .__c3
__s.x__so the ones i've been thinking of are all sort of uh power responsibility .__c3
__s__i guess husband wife is yet another one .__c3
__x__and so you know in discourse analysis you get things like @reject@ the role .__c8
__s^aap^cs__ach !__c3
__s^e__you have - you have a role in relationships and it has to do with your negotiating your - how you're perceived and how y- - and how the other @reject@ ==__c8
__qy^d^f^g__huh .__c3
__s.%-__role yeah .__c2
__s^bu__yeah .__c2
__fh__you know and so there are various things you negotiate .__c8
__s^aa__and i'm - i'm wondering if we might be able to do it s- - in sort of a loose way but e- - with - by having a searchable field like role .__c8
__b__and then you know within this context this person has the following roles and it could be very loose .__c8
__s.%--__uhhuh .__c3
__s:s__yeah .__c2
__s:s__but then it would be possible to do something as simple as a grep across a database .__c8
__s:qw__and if you're interested in you know which - which - which ones this person serves as an advisor in and versus you know a l- - uh s- - uh whatever a leader speaker whatever you could just grep for role and - and you know some - some particular value .__c8
__s__uhhuh .__c3
__%--__so it sounds like having the facility is great .__c1
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__and then over a period of time as the research happens on this we might develop some of these categories that would be generally useful .__c1
__s.x__some more .__c3
__s.x__and it - it sounds like a good thing to do .__c1
__s__and ==__c8
__s^bu__okay .__c3
__s^bk.%__interesting good .__c8
__s^aa|s__and systematize also maybe the encoding of it if - as we find some are useful and some are not so useful .__c8
__qw__nope .__c3
__fg__yeah | so what i have right now is all pairwise .__c3
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__so that's probably not sufficient .__c3
__s^rt__i think you don't need to have that much structure built in and that would be less time consuming to do it this way first and then find out what structure's needed .__c8
__s__yeah maybe not .__c3
__s__yep okay .__c3
__s__what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that - without this ?__c4
__s__will - will somebody go back and fill that in or we just won't have it or ?==__c4
__s^df__well i think that in a lot of the meetings people won't be filling this out anyway .__c3
__s__so really what i want to have is a place that if a researcher wants that information they can add it .__c3
__s^rt__huh .__c4
__s^rt__almost all of the meetings that we have are recorded with roughly this group .__c1
__s__right .__c3
__s.%--__uh and uh | you know and a fair minority with the group that we have in the morning .__c1
__s.%--__so this is not a lot of people .__c1
__s__we could easily - there's just a couple other meetings that ==__c1
__s^e__right .__c3
__b.%__so it - we can regenerate a lot of this information .__c3
__fg|s__so it wouldn't be that hard to go back and ==__c4
__s__yeah .__c4
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__but - even if we can't generate it i think it's all right to have some of the sections in your database blank that this information was not collected for this meeting .__c3
__%-__uhhuh .__c4
__s^bk|s^no__and there's just not going to be a way around that .__c3
__s__that's just going to happen .__c3
__s__like the n s a meeting the networks meeting .__c3
__b__i don't think they're going to want to fill out that information .__c3
__s^bk__yeah .__c4
__s__so ==__c3
__s.%--__okay enough on forms .__c3
__s__okay | so we're running kind of late .__c1
__s__okay .__c2
__b__so we'll probably want to zip through some other things maybe do some more time on - on jose's stuff later .__c1
__fg|s__um uh status of transcription .__c1
__s:s__uh i guess you know we - we recently woke up um our friends .__c1
__s__and uh ==__c1
__s^f__so i - i guess - you've sent off this - the uh c d roms .__c1
__s.%--__and you got some response from - from uh i b m about ?==__c1
__s__they haven't received them yet .__c3
__s__but i did get a response from them saying yes we're still alive .__c3
__s.%--__we haven't done anything yet basically .__c3
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__and uh ==__c3
__qy^d^f^g__was there some suggestion that they might soon or ?==__c1
__s^df__yeah .__c3
__s^rt__yeah .__c1
__s__so - so they've transferred the responsibility to someone else .__c3
__s__i can't remember his name .__c3
__s__mccoond .__c1
__s^rt__mccoond ?__c3
__s__yeah .__c1
__s__something like that .__c3
__b__but uh ==__c3
__s__and so he sent me email and said he's going to be starting to work on it .__c3
__s__and i haven't received anything else .__c3
__s__great okay .__c1
__s__so ==__c3
__s__well that was that one .__c1
__qy^bh__uhhuh .__c2
__fh__um ==__c1
__s__so tomorrow i'll send a email and just ask if he received it .__c3
__s.%--__he should be getting it today .__c3
__s^df__actually he should have gotten it yesterday .__c3
__s__but - give him a day .__c3
__s__um | and i think we should just sort of look at this thing from you off line jose .__c1
__b__because it's getting kind of late .__c1
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__but i mean i think the bottom line just glancing through it is that there's - there's a lot of overlap in just energy related things .__c1
__s^rt.%--__yeah .__c2
__s__and so you need something else .__c1
__s__i mean that's sort of ==__c1
__s^rt.%--__okay .__c2
__s__right ?__c1
__b__and uh what - the - so i'd ==__c1
__s^df__what about that error that - that uh the - the supposed lub- ?==__c4
__b__the residual error ?__c1
__qy^d^f^g__no | the supposed bug that was - that we were ==__c4
__s__we were guessing you had a bug before .__c4
__s__because you went through and you concatenated all of these things together ==__c4
__b__uhhuh .__c8
__s__uh yeah yeah .__c2
__s^df__i - i found the error and i repeated the experiments .__c2
__s^na__uh and here uh you can find the new results uh with ==__c2
__s^bk__uh .__c4
__qy^d^rt__okay | so this is post bug fix .__c1
__s^bk|s^ba__yeah yeah .__c2
__s^tc__okay ?__c2
__s__good okay .__c1
__s^bk__so um - | so i had two thought just glancing through this .__c1
__qy^rt__so one is - one is that um that uh we might want to talk about normalization .__c1
__s^aa__i mean i don't know what normalizations you use .__c1
__s^aa__sometimes things have more overlap before you've done some kind of normalization .__c1
__s__and we might think about what different kinds of normalizations are possible .__c1
__%--__yeah .__c2
__qy^rt__and the other thing is that if that isn't @reject@ uh so much of the issue then probably ==__c1
__qy^e__yeah .__c2
__qy.%-__i mean residual l p c energy and just plain energy are very closely related even though they're different .__c1
__s^na__and um so um you really may need to go to something that looks at i- - in some sense harmonicity or um um relationship to or - fit - fit to pitch tracks on uh - on either side of - of it for instance .__c1
__s^bk|qy.%--__yeah .__c2
__qy__huh .__c3
__s^na__yeah .__c2
__s^df__you know so if - if there's uh a really bad fit between where the pitch is going in this suppose - uh hypothesized region of overlap and the - the - and one or the other uh side you know then this - this - this might uh suggest a ==__c1
__s__another side .__c2
__b__an alteration in th- - in the tracking way .__c2
__s__excuse me ?__c1
__b__you mean that uh you um huh ==__c2
__b__i understand that uh you - you mean uh to - to study the alteration between the - the tracking of the pitch uh if we compare the overlapping zone with a speaker zone .__c2
__s:s^fe__i- - if you have two - if you have two - if you have uh two people speaking uh and there's an overlap then - i mean the first thing is that there should be a mixture of harmonics uh during overlapped voice sections anyway .__c1
__b__in the co- - in the context .__c2
__b__yeah .__c2
__s__uhhuh .__c2
__s__and um the - any - a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best guess at a particular harmonic sequence it's also going to be a smaller fraction .__c1
__b__this is you know related to the harmonicity sort of thing .__c1
__b__uhhuh .__c2
__fg|s^cs__and then the other thing i'm saying is that if you look at the temporal evolution of the pitch there should be something like a discontinuity there .__c1
__s^2__yeah .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__fg|s^t^tc__now there's other places where you'll have discontinuities in pitch and speech .__c1
__s__but - but - maybe it'll have something to - have a different character .__c1
__s__but it seems like energy - energy tells you something .__c1
__s__but uh if - unless this is a normalization problem it looks from your results like there's so much overlap that certainly you need something that isn't energy like in addition to it at least .__c1
__qy^rt__uhhuh .__c2
__s__okay .__c2
__s^bk__are - are the things in the ?==__c4
__s__i don't normalicized uh in these uh- - experiments by the moment .__c2
__s^2__i don't normalicize .__c2
__b__okay | so the question is - is - would some kind of normalization help ?__c1
__%-__yeah .__c2
__s^df__you know uh i- - i- - it could be that if you normalized uh by the overall um energy uh for uh you know some - some longer period of time or something uh that - that there would be more of a distinction .__c1
__s^bk__nnn .__c2
__s^bk__yeah .__c2
__s^df__the different zone .__c2
__s^df__uh i - i don't know .__c1
__s^bk__so uh | from - from these charts are ==__c4
__b.%__yeah .__c2
